      "2": "Web-based intelligent tutoring systems try to fill the gap between human teachers and printed textbooks as distance learning aids. Actually, intelligent tutoring systems research is concerned with the development of computer tools that show adaptive capabilities in the domain of tutoring, where the student's progress is autonomously monitored and guided according to some tutoring strategy. This paper provides details on the analysis, design and implementation of such a system. STIA (Sistema Tutor en Internet de Ajedrez) is a fully implemented Web-based tool developed to provide adaptive guidance and help while learning chess basics. In STIA the task of the tutor is to guide the student efficiently through the course material, according to the tutoring strategy defined by the course authors. This is achieved in two ways. First, it imposes limits on the portion of course material the students can access. This prevents them from getting lost in a flood of information. Second, the tutor evaluates each student's knowledge through a set of problems, and according to result recommends reviewing theory, solving more problems or advancing through the course.",
      "5": "In this paper we present TDLEAF( ), a variation on the TD( ) algorithm that enables it to be used in conjunction with game-tree search. We present some experiments in which our chess program \"KnightCap\" used TDLEAF( ) to learn its evaluation function while playing on Internet chess servers. The main success we report is that KnightCap improved from a 1650 rating to a 2150 rating in just 308 games and 3 days of play. As a reference, a rating of 1650 corresponds to about level B human play (on a scale from E (1000) to A (1800)), while 2150 is human master level. We discuss some of the reasons for this success, principle among them being the use of on-line, rather than self-play. We also investigate whether TDLEAF( ) can yield better results in the domain of backgammon, where TD( ) has previously yielded striking success.",
      "7": "Temporal dierence (TD) learning is a natural method of reinforcement learning that is particularly appropriate for learning in heuristic search and game playing. Sutton [Machine Learning 3 (1988)  9\u00b144] introduced the TD(k) method which is an elegant integration of supervised learning with TD learning. TD(k) enabled Tesauro\u00d5s backgammon program to reach world championship standard. But it can be slow. Tesauro\u00d5s program was trained on 1 500 000 games. Recent work [D.F. Beal, M.C. Smith, Temporal coherence and prediction decay in temporal dierence learning. Technical Report no. 756, Department of Computer Science, Queen Mary and West\u00aeeld College, University of London, 1998] has described a signi\u00aecant algorithmic improvement (temporal coherence) that controls learning rates, and produces more stable \u00aenal values. Results from a random walk task, and two complex real-world games are presented here to show that temporal coherence (TC) produces faster learning than earlier methods, and that TD learning can produce values that are superior to standard values for speci\u00aeed search regimes, without any domain-speci\u00aec information or human assistance. In the chess domain, we also describe the emergence of classic human elementary knowledge in the pattern of weights learnt from self-play, starting with weights initialised to zero.",
      "8": "Expert systems by de\"nition address a particular domain; arguably this focus on particular domains is a lesson from the 1960s where the early enthusiasm for creating arti,cial intelligence (e.g. natural language understanding) was hampered by the realization that the context of understanding is extremely varying and intractable.",
      "9": "In the half century since minimax was \u00aerst suggested as a strategy for adversary game search, various search algorithms have been developed. The standard approach has been to use improvements to the Alpha\u00b1Beta (a\u00b1b) algorithm. Some of the more powerful improvements examine continuations beyond the nominal search depth if they are of special interest, while others terminate the search early. The latter case is referred to as forward pruning.",
      "11": "Most parallel game-tree search approaches use synchronous methods, where the work is concentrated within a specific part of the tree or at a given search depth. This article shows that asynchronous game-tree search algorithms can be as efficient as or better than synchronous methods in determining the minimax value.",
      "13": "summarized evidence that people can remember about seven chunks in short-term memory (STM) tasks. However, that number was meant more as a rough estimate and a rhetorical device than as a real capacity limit. Others have since suggested that there is a more precise capacity limit, but that it is only three to five chunks. The present target article brings together a wide variety of data on capacity limits suggesting that the smaller capacity limit is real. Capacity limits will be useful in analyses of information processing only if the boundary conditions for observing them can be carefully described. Four basic conditions in which chunks can be identified and capacity limits can accordingly be observed are: (1) when information overload limits chunks to individual stimulus items, (2) when other steps are taken specifically to block the recoding of stimulus items into larger chunks, (3) in performance discontinuities caused by the capacity limit, and (4) in various indirect effects of the capacity limit. Under these conditions, rehearsal and long-term memory cannot be used to combine stimulus items into chunks of an unknown size; nor can storage mechanisms that are not capacitylimited, such as sensory memory, allow the capacity-limited storage mechanism to be refilled during recall. A single, central capacity limit averaging about four chunks is implicated along with other, noncapacity-limited sources. The pure STM capacity limit expressed in chunks is distinguished from compound STM limits obtained when the number of separately held chunks is unclear. Reasons why pure capacity estimates fall within a narrow range are discussed and a capacity limit for the focus of attention is proposed.",
      "17": "s (1995) theoretical framework of long-term working memory (LTWM) accounts for how experts acquire encoding and retrieval mechanisms to adapt to real-time demands of working memory during representative interactions with their natural environments. The transfer of the same LTWM mechanisms is shown to account for the expertise effect in unrepresentative \"contrived\" memory tests. Therefore, K. J. Vicente and J. H. Wang's (1998) critique of the generalizability of the LTWM framework is rejected. Their proposed refutation of LTWM accounts is found to be based on misrepresented facts. The process-based framework of LTWM is shown to be superior to their product theory because it can explain interactions of the expertise effect in \"contrived\" recall under several testing conditions differing in presentation rate, instructions, and memory procedures.",

The material is organized around a variety of problems that typically arise in game playing and that can be solved with machine learning methods. This approach, we believe, allows both, researchers in game playing to find appropriate learning techniques for helping to solve their problems as well as machine learning researchers to identify rewarding topics for further research in game-playing domains. The paper covers learning techniques that range from neural networks to decision tree learning in games that range from poker to chess. However, space constraints prevent us from giving detailed introductions to the used learning techniques or games. Overall, we aimed at striking a fair balance between being exhaustive and being exhausting.",

      "27": "For many years, the game of chess has provided an invaluable task environment for research on cognition, in particular on the differences between novices and experts and the learning that removes these differences, and upon the structure of human memory and its paramaters. The template theory presented by Gobet and Simon based on the EPAM theory offers precise predictions on cognitive processes during the presentation and recall of chess positions. This article describes the behavior of CHREST, a computer implementation of the template theory, in a memory task when the presentation time is varied from one second to sixty, on the recall of game and random positions, and compares the model to human data. Strong players are better than weak players in both types of positions, especially with long presentation times, but even after brief presentations. CHREST predicts the data, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Strong players' superiority with random positions is explained by the large number of chunks they hold in LTM. Their excellent recall with short presentation times is explained by templates, a special class of chunks. CHREST is compared to other theories of chess skill, which either cannot account for the superiority of Masters in random positions or predict too strong a performance of Masters in such positions.",
      "28": "The chessmaps heuristic is a pattern-oriented approach to ordering moves for the game of chess. It uses a neural network to learn a relation between the control of the squares and the influence of a move. Depending on what squares a player controls, the chessmaps heuristic tries to determine where the important areas of the chessboard are. Moves that influence these important areas are then ordered first. The heuristic has been incorporated into a move-ordering algorithm that also takes account of immediate tactical threats. Human players also rely strongly on patterns when selecting moves, but would also consider immediate tactical threats, so this move-ordering algorithm is an attempt to mimic something of the human thought process when selecting a move. This paper presents a new definition for the influence of a move, which improves the performance of the heuristic. It also presents a new experience-based approach to determining what areas of the chessboard are important, which may actually be preferred to the chessmaps heuristic. The results from game-tree searches suggest that the move-ordering algorithm could compete with the current best alternative of using the history heuristic with capture moves in a brute-force search.",
      "31": "Superstars are not by accident a conspicuous phenomenon in our culture, but inherently belong to a meritocratic society with mass media, free enterprise, and competition. To make this contention plausible I will use Caillois's book, Man, Play and Games, 1 to compare the mechanisms underlying the superstar phenomenon with a special kind of game, as set out by Caillois. As far as I know, Caillois's book is not quoted in the literature dealing with income distribution theories, although the comparison with play and games is, for limited purposes, interesting. In play and games we find almost all elements which play a role in theories of just income distribution: equality of opportunity, chance, talent, competition and skill, reward, entitlement, winners and losers, etc. These are not chance similarities, for \". . . games are largely dependent upon the cultures in which they are practised. They affect their preferences, prolong their customs, and reflect their beliefs . . . One . . . can . . . posit a truly reciprocal relationship between a society and the games it likes to play\". 2 Moreover, as we will see, superstars combine the four basic characteristics of play that make their activities a special kind of play.",
      "32": "Pocket computers are beginning to emerge that provide sufficient processing capability and memory capacity to run traditional desktop applications and operating systems on them. The increasing demand placed on these systems by software is competing against the continuing trend in the design of low-power microprocessors towards increasing the amount of computation per unit of energy. Consequently, in spite of advances in low-power circuit design, the microprocessor is likely to continue to account for a significant portion of the overall power consumption of pocket computers. This paper investigates clock scaling algorithms on the Itsy, an experimental pocket computer that runs a complete, functional multitasking operating system (a version of Linux 2.0.30). We implemented a number of clock scaling algorithms that are used to adjust the processor speed to reduce the power used by the processor. After testing these algorithms, we conclude that currently proposed algorithms consistently fail to achieve their goal of saving power while not causing user applications to change their interactive behavior.",

      "43": "Despite the undisputed strength of today's chess-playing programs, the fact that they have to evaluate millions, or even billions, of different positions per move is unsatisfactory. The amount of \"computation\" carried out by human players is smaller by orders of magnitudes because they employ specific patterns that help them narrow the search tree. Similar approach should in principle be feasible also in computer programs. To draw attenion to this issue, we report our experiments with a program that learns to classify chessboard positions that permit the well-known bishop sacrifice at h7. We discuss some problems pertaining to the collection of training examples, their representation, and pre-classification. Classification accuracies achieved with a decision-tree based classifier are encouraging.",

Is that true? Results obtained with a dynamic, chessbased wargame indicate that the answer to this question is no -the absolute level of uncertainty is important. More specifically the results show that as the absolute level of uncertainty increases, the value of having information superiority as well as the value of having superior strength decreases, whereas the value of having tempo superiority remains unaffected. Two conclusions are drawn. The first is that information superiority may be best created at lower levels of command where uncertainty is at its lowest. The second is that because uncertainty probably will continue to be a problem in war, tempo superiority may be a more viable alternative than information superiority or superior strength for winning.",

When a game tree is too large to be examined exhaustively, the standard method for computers to play games is as follows. A partial game tree (envelope) is chosen for examination. This partial game tree may be any subtree of the complete game tree, rooted at the starting position. It is explored by the help of the \u03b1\u03b2-algorithm, or any of its variants. All \u03b1\u03b2variants have in common that a single faulty leaf evaluation may cause a wrong decision at the root. To overcome this insecurity, we propose Cc2s, a new algorithm, which selects an envelope in a way that the decision at the root is stable against a single faulty evaluation. At the same time, it examines this envelope efficiently. We describe the algorithm and analyze its time behavior and correctness. Moreover, we are presenting some experimental results from the domain of chess. Cc2s is used in the parallel chess program P.ConNerS, which won the",

However, the large search spaces normally occurring robotics and expensive training experiences required by reinforcement learning algorithms has hampered its applicability. This paper introduces a new approach for reinforcement learning based on a relational representation which: (i) can be applied over large search spaces, (ii) can incorporate domain knowledge, and (iii) can use previously learned policies on different, although similar, problems. In the proposed framework states are represented as sets of first order relations, actions in terms of those relations, and policies are learned over such generalized representation. It is shown how this representation can capture large search spaces with a relatively small set of actions and states, and that policies learned over this generalized representation can be directly apply to other problems which can be characterized by the same set of relations.",

One of its applications is in Tsuitate-Tsume-Shogi (mating problems in a Kriegspiel-like variant of Shogi). This approach relies on the use of metapositions. A metaposition is a hybrid complex of possible positions that are not distinguishable for the solver. In this contribution, we examine four methods for encoding a metaposition into some value with fewer bits in order to use a transposition table. Each encoding method is tested in a search process, using a benchmark test set of 102 problems. They show us that the efficiency of search by using a transposition table is improved by a factor of eight. The four encoding methods make use of (1) arithmetic sum, (2) exclusive-OR sum, (3) two cyclic redundancy check codes, and (4) a secure hash function. The method of exclusive-OR sum proves not to be acceptably resistant to type-1 errors in this domain; the others are. Though the execution time is roughly comparable among the other three methods, the arithmetic sum is slightly superior in our implementation.",

      "79": "Theory of mind is the field devoted to understanding how organisms discern the mental states of others. Because mental states are not directly observable, they can only be inferred from observable features of the actor (such as behavior) and the situational context that the actor is in. Social psychologists, who study theory of mind processes under the rubric of attribution research, have shown that people often make a logical error of inference: The ``fundamental attribution error'' (FAE) is the tendency to assume that an actor's behavior and mental state correspond to a degree that is logically unwarranted by the situation. The social environment in which theory of mind capacities evolved may have influenced attributional processing in ways that could explain the error. In particular, the error could be caused by a psyche that is designed (1) to consider only those noncorresponding mental states (such as deception) that could have fitness consequences to the mind reader; (2) to bias inferences in a way that reduces the costs of erroneous inferences; or (3) to bias inferences in a way that yields reputational benefits. The existing literature is reviewed in light of these hypotheses.",

TD learning is used to adjust the weights for evaluation features over the course of a series of games, starting from arbitrary initial values. For some games, to obtain weights accurate enough for high-performance play will require the TD learning phase to make use of minimax searches. A theoretical description of TD applied to minimax search is given, and we discuss how the theoretical characteristics of the method interact with practical considerations. These include the depth of search appropriate for successful learning and the use of self-play to enable the algorithm to be independent of human knowledge. We then report on experiments that obtained values for use in shogi-playing programs. Unlike chess, shogi has no generally agreed standardized set of values for pieces, so there is more need for machine learning. We compare our machine-learnt values, obtained without any human knowledge input, with hand-crafted values. TD learning was successful in obtaining values that performed well in matches against hand-crafted values.",

Experts made fewer fixations per trial and greater amplitude saccades than did intermediates, but there was no difference in fixation duration across skill groups. Examining the spatial distribution of the first five fixations for each position by skill group revealed that experts produced more fixations on empty squares than did intermediates. When fixating pieces, experts produced a greater proportion of fixations on relevant pieces than did intermediates. It is argued that expert chess players perceptually encode chess configurations, rather than individual pieces, and, consequently, parafoveal or peripheral processing guides their eye movements, producing a pattern of saccadic selectivity by piece saliency.",

When paired comparison outcomes are collected over time and the merits of the units may be changing, it is often convenient to assume the data follow a non-linear state-space model. Typical paired comparison state-space models that assume a \u00ae xed (unknown) autoregressive variance do not account for the possibility of sudden changes in the merits. This is a particular concern, for example, in modeling cognitive ability in human development; cognitive ability not only changes over time, but also can change abruptly. We explore a particular extension of conventional state-space models for paired comparison data that allows the state variance to vary stochastically. Models of this type have recently been developed and applied to modeling \u00ae nancial data, but can be seen to have applicability in modeling paired comparison data.

We distinguish two forms of chunking: the first deliberate, under strategic control, and goal-oriented; the second automatic, continuous, and linked to perceptual processes. Recent work with discrimination-network computational models of long-and short-term memory (EPAM/CHREST) has produced a diverse range of applications of perceptual chunking.

The average rating gain per search iteration shrinks by half from 169 ELO at 6 plies to 84 ELO at 12 plies.

The experiments carried out by Beal and Smith, using random minimaxing in Chess, showed that the strength of play increases as the depth of the lookahead is increased. We investigate random minimaxing from a combinatorial point of view in an attempt to gain a better understanding of the utility of the minimax procedure and a theoretical justification for the results of Beal and Smith's experiments. The concept of domination is central to our theory. Intuitively, one move by white dominates another move when choosing the former move would give less choice for black when it is black's turn to move, and subsequently more choice for white when it is white's turn to move. We view domination as a measure of mobility and show that when one move dominates another then its probability of being chosen is higher.",

In the rst experimental phase, subjects had to analyse a source problem.

Subjects had then to solve diVerent tests (solving isomorphic problems, recall tests, similarity tests) designed to answer two questions: The rst question was to test whether the experimental manipulation in the two groups had in fact generated knowledge that varied in abstractness; the second question was to determine whether generalisation is accompanied by storage of surface features of the source problem.

It will be argued that modern theoretical concepts of attention, imagery and memory are based on underlying concepts of capacity and format and that these concepts are not sufficiently powerful to express all phenomena associated with mental contents. Instead, one must develop a genuinely content-oriented theoretical language to discuss, for example, contents and their integration into thinking. The main problem is how to explain the contents of representations. Why do representations have precisely the contents that they have. Here the main attention will be focussed on the question how can one explain the selection of content elements in representations. To formulate the basic concepts of contentoriented thought research several issues must be discussed. Firstly, it will be shown that traditional attention and memory research is capacity-oriented and therefore unable to express mental contents. Secondly, it will be argued that there are content phenomena which must be explained by properties of other content phenomena. Thirdly, it will be shown that in chess, people integrate information into representations by using functional rules or reasons, i.e. concepts and rules, which tell why some information contents must be included in a representation. It will then be shown that people integrate information around learned 'thought models' whose contents, together with functional rules or reasons, explain and clarify the contentstructure of a mental representation. It will also be argued that the analysis of contents is metascientifically closer to linguistics with its basic method of explication and content analysis than natural sciences, which form the most common underlying model in current experimental psychology. Finally, content-oriented cognitive psychology and its presuppositions will be compared with neural and computational approaches to show that it gives an additional and alternative theoretical resource, but not a contradictory conceptual platform, to the previous theoretical ways of working with human thinking.",

      "149": "This article presents the results of experiments designed to gain insight into the effect of the minimax algorithm on the error of a heuristic evaluation function. Two types of effect of minimax are considered: (a) evaluation accuracy (are the minimax backed-up values more accurate than the heuristic values themselves?), and (b) decision accuracy (are moves played by deeper minimax search better than those by shallower search?). The experiments were performed in the KRK chess endgame and in randomly generated game trees. The results show that, counter-intuitively, evaluation accuracy may decline with search depth, whereas at the same time decision accuracy improves with depth. In the article, this is explained by the fact that minimax in combination with a noisy evaluation function introduces a bias into the backed-up evaluations, which masks the evaluation effectiveness of minimax, but this bias still permits decision accuracy to improve with depth. This observed behaviour of minimax in the KRK endgame is discussed in the light of previous studies of pathology in minimax. It is shown that explaining the behaviour of minimax in an actual chess endgame in terms of previously known results requires special care.",

We make the realistic assumption that the players are boundedly rational: they base their actions on finite-order belief hierarchies. When the different layers of beliefs are independent of each other, we can retain Hars\u00e1nyi's type-space, and we can define straightforward generalizations of Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (bne) and Rationalizability in our context. Since neither of these concepts is quite satisfactory, we propose a hybrid concept, Mirage Equilibrium, providing us with a practical tool to work with inconsistent belief hierarchies. When the different layers of beliefs are correlated, we must enlarge the type-space to include the parametric beliefs. This presents us with the difficulty of the inherent openness of finite belief subspaces. Appealing to bounded rationality once more, we posit that the players believe that their opponent holds a belief hierarchy one layer shorter than they do and we provide alternative generalizations of bne and Rationalizability. Finally, we show that, when beliefs are degenerate point beliefs, the definition of Mirage Equilibrium coincides with that of the generalized bne.",

An alternative view is that what information is encoded in a chess chunk is determined more by processing of the attack/defense relations during evaluation. In three experiments, participants evaluated positions and completed recognition tests. Experiment 1 supported the view that expert players make more use of attack/defense relations than of locations of pieces in a recognition test. Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated that, for both long and short presentation times, expert players' recognition for a piece within a position was primed more by a piece related by attack or defense than by a piece merely proximal.

The un-propagated positions are then declared draws. However, in Chinese chess, there are special rules other than checkmate and stalemate to end a game. Therefore, some terminal positions cannot be determined by the typical retrograde analysis algorithm. If these special rules are ignored in the construction of the endgame databases, the resulting databases may contain incorrect information.

      "268": "This paper presents a learning theory pertinent to dynamic decision making (DDM) called instancebased learning theory (IBLT). IBLT proposes five learning mechanisms in the context of a decision-making process: instance-based knowledge, recognition-based retrieval, adaptive strategies, necessity-based choice, and feedback updates. IBLT suggests in DDM people learn with the accumulation and refinement of instances, containing the decision-making situation, action, and utility of decisions. As decision makers interact with a dynamic task, they recognize a situation according to its similarity to past instances, adapt their judgment strategies from heuristic-based to instance-based, and refine the accumulated knowledge according to feedback on the result of their actions. The IBLT's learning mechanisms have been implemented in an ACT-R cognitive model. Through a series of experiments, this paper shows how the IBLT's learning mechanisms closely approximate the relative trend magnitude and performance of human data. Although the cognitive model is bounded within the context of a dynamic task, the IBLT is a general theory of decision making applicable to other dynamic environments.",
      "270": "Most strong game-playing programs use large, well tuned opening books to guide them through the early stages of the game. However, in shogi (Japanese chess) the classic approach of building a large opening book of known positions is infeasible. In this paper, we present a different approach for opening and middle game play in shogi. This method uses board maps that assign values to each square for each piece in a number of different formations. Hill-climbing is then used to guide pieces to optimal squares. We define board maps for defensive piece formations (castles), attacking formations (assaults) and for recognizing the type of opening position. Results show that using board maps in combination with hill-climbing significantly improves the playing strength of a shogi program. Furthermore, using maps for both castles and assaults is better than using only maps for castles.",

Our tool helps the developer to remain oriented while exploring and navigating across a code base.

The heuristic uses a neural network to estimate the likelihood of a move being the best in a certain position. The moves considered more likely to be the best are examined first. We develop an enhanced approach to apply the NMM heuristic during the search, by using a weighted combination of the neural-network scores and the history-heuristic scores. Moreover, we analyse the influence of existing game databases and opening theory on the design of the training patterns. The NMM heuristic is tested for middle-game chess positions by the program CRAFTY. The experimental results indicate that the NMM heuristic outperforms the existing move ordering, especially when a weighted-combination approach is chosen.",

In order for a theory to meet with wide-spread acceptance, it is important that the model be reproducible and comprehensible by independent researchers.

Previous authors have suggested that computer models should be developed using high-level specification languages or large amounts of documentation. We argue that neither suggestion is sufficient, as each deals with the prescriptive definition of the model, and does not aid in generalising the use of the model to new contexts. Instead, we argue that a computational model should be released as three components: (a) a well-documented implementation; (b) a set of tests illustrating each of the key processes within the model; and (c) a set of canonical results, for reproducing the model's predictions in important experiments. The included tests and experiments would provide the concrete exemplars required for easier comprehension of the model, as well as a confirmation that independent implementations and later versions reproduce the theory's canonical results.",

The results indicate that tempo and material are both advantageous, but that the degree of advantage is highly dependent on skill level.

In addition, searching one move deeper than an otherwise equally matched opponent equates to an advantage of between 85%-98%.",

      "324": "Kriegspiel is a Chess variant similar to wargames, in which players have to deal with uncertainty. Kriegspiel increases the difficulty typical of Chess by hiding from each player his opponent's moves. Although it is a two person game it needs a referee, whose task consists in accepting the legal moves and rejecting the illegal ones, with respect to the real situation. Neither player knows the whole history of moves and each player has to guess the state of the game on the basis of messages received from the referee. A player's try may result legal or illegal, and a legal move may prove to be a capture or a check. The paper describes the rationale of a program to play basic endgames of Kriegspiel, where a player has left only the King. These endings have been theoretically studied with rule-based mechanisms, whereas few researches exist on a gametree-based approach. We show how the branch of game tree can be reduced in order to employ an evaluation function and a search algorithm. Then we deal with game situations dependent on stochastic element and we show how we resolve them during the tree visit.",

      "327": "Two types of mechanisms may underlie chess skill: fast mechanisms, such as recognition, and slow mechanisms, such as search through the space of possible moves and responses. Speed distinguishes these mechanisms, so I examined archival data on blitz chess (5 min for the whole game), in which the opportunities for search are greatly reduced. If variation in fast processes accounts for substantial variation in chess skill, performance in blitz chess should correlate highly with a player's overall skill. In addition, restricting search processes should tend to equalize skill difference between players, but this effect should decrease as overall skill level increases. Analyses of three samples of blitz chess tournaments supported both hypotheses. Search is undoubtedly important, but up to 81% of variance in chess skill (measured by rating) was accounted for by how players performed with less than 5% of the normal time available.",
      "328": "Previous research has suggested that depth of search in chess does not increase much as a function of skill. We submitted players to a problem-solving task with complex positions. We found a strong skill effect in depth of search, rate of search, and number of nodes generated. At the level of strong masters, the absolute values of these variables were much higher than in previous studies (sometimes 10 times higher). Supplementary data on memory, practice, reaction times, and timeconstrained decision making (a maximum decision time of 10 seconds) indicated that players' behaviour was consistent with the behaviour of players previously studied in the literature and with predictions of theories based on pattern recognition. Beyond adding support to the hypothesis that both the ability to search and pattern recognition are relevant aspects of expert thinking, these results are important in showing that previous research has vastly underestimated experts' search potential. We conclude that long-term memory knowledge allows both extensive search and rapid evaluation when making decisions under time pressure.

However, how the mind's eye filters out relevant from irrelevant information is still underspecified in the theory. We describe two experiments addressing this question, in which chess games are presented visually, move by move, on a board that contains irrelevant information (static positions, semi-static positions, and positions changing every move). The results show that irrelevant information affects chess masters only when it changes during the presentation of the target game. This suggests that novelty information is used by the mind's eye to select incoming visual information and separate \"figure\" and \"ground.\" Mechanisms already present in the template theory can be used to account for this novelty effect.",

However, in many domains, including spam detection, intrusion detection, fraud detection, surveillance and counter-terrorism, this is far from the case: the data is actively manipulated by an adversary seeking to make the classifier produce false negatives. In these domains, the performance of a classifier can degrade rapidly after it is deployed, as the adversary learns to defeat it. Currently the only solution to this is repeated, manual, ad hoc reconstruction of the classifier. In this paper we develop a formal framework and algorithms for this problem. We view classification as a game between the classifier and the adversary, and produce a classifier that is optimal given the adversary's optimal strategy. Experiments in a spam detection domain show that this approach can greatly outperform a classifier learned in the standard way, and (within the parameters of the problem) automatically adapt the classifier to the adversary's evolving manipulations.",

The suggested implications include the importance of perception in learning, the cost of acquiring knowledge, the significance of segmenting and ordering instruction material, the role of the variability of the instructional material in acquiring schemata, and the importance of taking individual differences into account.",

These chess attributes will serve for testing new ideas in planning. The idea is to investigate whether good automatically learnt policies for a planning problem can be generated using training examples along with evolutionary algorithms. The training examples, used as input to the learning algorithm, describe specific descriptions of a number of solved instances in one domain; then to improve the learnt policies obtained from the training examples, the policies should evolve. We believe that the domain of games is well-suited for testing these new ideas in planning.",
      "368": "Recent research has proposed that groupware performance may be affected by two factors, the strongest of which is the fit between the task and the groupware structures selected for use. We suggest that the link is deeper; there needs to be a fit between the task and the group's cognitive structures as mapped to the groupware structures. In this paper we address this shortcoming by integrating recent theories of cognition (distributed cognition, transactive memory and template theory) from the perspective of electronic collaboration. We refine the concept of cognitive fit as applied to group work and offer propositions for further study. We show that template core data is used during situation assessment and that slot data refines response selection. Finally, we propose several techniques by which the group cognitive effort can be minimized, thereby leaving more capacity for the collective task. This approach is especially applicable to naturalistic group decision situations.",

Nevertheless, most of the AI research has been focused on the refinement of evaluation functions which are used to search the NP-complete solution space. Some optimizations have also been made to the arrangement in which possible moves are examined by the search algorithm. In this article we take a nouvelle approach to the generation of chess moves with the help of multi-agent based systems. We design a multi-agent system which represents the pieces of a chess battlefield and we feed the search algorithm with the most promising move(s) from the point of view of the individual agents. Thus, we take into account the individual decisions (tactics) to define the strategy, as well as cutting out the search space. We plan to make a prototype implementation of the multi-agent based chess move generator system (MAB-CMGS) using the FIPA-OS architecture to test the overall system behaviour and achievable chess power.",

To normalize the chessboard image with different perspectives, the chessboard corners are found and each chessboard square is divided into 8*8 smaller squares. Several variations of Gradient Descent algorithms in Back Propagation are examined. Although there is still much work to be done, the ANN approach has revealed its convenience and performance in this task.",

This approach can reduce search effort by a large margin. However, it suffers from the so-called Graph History Interaction (GHI) problem, which causes errors in games containing repeated positions. This paper presents a practical solution to the GHI problem that combines and extends previous techniques. Because our scheme is general, it is applicable to different game tree search algorithms and to different domains. As demonstrated with the two algorithms \u03b1\u03b2 and df-pn in the two games checkers and Go, our scheme incurs only a very small overhead, while guaranteeing the correctness of solutions.",

In this paper we consider a tactical sub-problem that needs to be addressed on the way to strong computer generated forces: abstract combat games in which a small number of inhomogeneous units battle with each other in simultaneous move rounds until all members of one group are eliminated. We present and test several adversarial heuristic search algorithms that are able to compute reasonable actions in those scenarios using short time controls. Tournament results indicate that a new algorithm for simultaneous move games which we call \"randomized alpha-beta search\" (RAB) can be used effectively in the abstract combat application we consider. In this application it outperforms the other algorithms we implemented. We also show that RAB's performance is correlated with the degree of simultaneous move interdependence present in the game.",
      "385": "Game tree search is the core of most attempts to make computers play games. Yet another approach is to store all possible positions in a database and to precompute the true values for all the positions. The databases allow computers to play optimally, in the sense that they will win every game once they reach a winning position. Moreover, they will never lose from a draw or win position. This is the situation that we find in games like Connect-4, in endgames of chess and in many other settings. Nevertheless, it has been observed that the programs do not play strongly when they have to play a tournament with strong, but non-perfect human players attending. In this paper we propose a mixture of game tree search and the database approach which attacks this problem on the basis of a known theoretical error analysis in game trees. Experiments show encouraging results.",

      "388": "In game-playing programs relying on the minimax principle, deeper searches generally produce better evaluations. Theoretical analyses, however, suggest that in many cases minimaxing amplifies the noise introduced by the heuristic function used to evaluate the leaves of the game tree, leading to what is known as pathological behavior, where deeper searches produce worse evaluations. In most of the previous research, positions were evaluated as losses or wins. Dependence between the values of positions close to each other was identified as the property of realistic game trees that eliminates the pathology and explains why minimax is successful in practice. In this paper we present an alternative explanation that does not rely on value dependence. We show that if real numbers are used for position values, position values tend to be further apart at lower levels of the game tree, which leads to a larger proportion of more extreme positions, where error is less probable. Decreased probability of error in searches to greater depths is sufficient to eliminate the pathology and no additional properties of game trees are required.",
      "389": "The application of self-play experiments to computer games was pioneered by Thompson in 1982 with his chess machine BELLE. Since then the technique has been widely used in a variety of games to train artificial players employing a range of artificial neural network architectures. Of particular note is the TD-learning Backgammon program of Tesauro developed in 1995. When developing artificial game players that learn by experience, it is generally possible to accelerate the training process through selfplay. Compared with training by humans, this confers the advantages of greater speed and a precise control of playing strength through parameter variation. In spite of these potential advantages, the use of self-play experiments is considered by many to be a treacherous road fraught with problems. The value of such experiments is unclear and the threshold of learning that can be achieved through self-play alone is unknown. There is the common-sense perception that only limited playing skill can be achieved through machine self-play, a notion that is challenged here. A new application that is immune from the problems associated with machine learning is the use of self-play experiments to test the integrity and fairness of games and modify the rules accordingly. We will show how the rules of a particular game, Perudo, can be analysed for fairness and how the excessive positive feedback that arises when forces become unbalanced can be curbed. We use the notion of fair in the same sense as in a soccer game -if a team loses a goal, neglecting psychological effects, the chance of losing a second goal is not significantly changed. It is recognised that the cumulative growth in advantage is part of many games and that it is inappropriate to alter the rules in these cases. However the rate at which advantages grow can be moderated by rule alterations. We will also consider the application of the technique to a range of traditional games. In chess, for example, White is considered to have an advantage over Black. The imbalance can be determined for different playing strengths and extrapolated. We will show that the principles can be extended to the more complex situations of computer games and propose that the development of unintelligent agents to explore game play is advantageous.",

Using such variates as input, we employ a multi-layer perceptron as a nonlinear evaluation function.

Our experiments using hundreds of games show that the proposed method works well in obtaining a very accurate evaluation function for shogi, whose performance is comparable to that of a strong shogi program.",

However, how the mind's eye filters out relevant from irrelevant information is still underspecified in the theory. We describe two experiments addressing this question, in which chess games are presented visually, move by move, on a board that contains irrelevant information (static positions, semistatic positions, and positions changing every move). The results show that irrelevant information affects chess masters only when it changes during the presentation of the target game. This suggests that novelty information is used by the mind's eye to select incoming visual information and separate ``figure'' and ``ground''. Mechanisms already present in the template theory can be used to account for this novelty effect.",

In this contrast, there was an extended brain activity in bilateral frontal areas such as the anterior cingulate and the superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri; furthermore, posterior areas, such as posterior cingulate and cerebellum, showed great bilateral activation.

In this article we argue that the best diagrams depict information the same way that our internal mental representations do. That is, \"visual thinking\" operates largely on relatively sketchy, cartoon-like representations of the physical world, translating sensory input into efficient codes before storing and manipulating it. Effective diagrams will assist this process by stripping away irrelevant detail while preserving or highlighting essential information about objects and their spatial relations.

Variables representing accumulated time spent on serious study alone, tournament play, and formal instruction were all significant bivariate correlates of chess skill as measured by tournament performance ratings. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that among the activities measured, serious study alone was the strongest predictor of chess skill in both samples, and that a combination of various chessrelated activities accounted for about 40% of the variance in chess skill ratings. However, the relevance of tournament play and formal instruction to skill varied as a function of skill measurement time (peak vs. current) and age group (above vs. below 40 years). Chess players at the highest skill level (i.e. grandmasters) expended about 5000 hours on serious study alone during their first decade of serious chess play-nearly five times the average amount reported by intermediate-level players. These results provide further evidence to support the argument that deliberate practice plays a critical role in the acquisition of chess expertise, and may be useful in addressing pedagogical issues concerning the optimal allocation of time to different chess learning activities.",

In four groups, we varied the JOL instruction (present versus absent) and the selection instruction (free number of move selections versus selection of at least two moves per chess exercise). After four learning trials, participants were required to play against a chess computer. In the learning phase, participants who were forced to select moves for restudy outperformed those who were free to select moves for restudy when predicting the next computer move, even after controlling for the actual number of restudied moves. Although the groups that did provide JOLs showed better self-regulatory behaviour, there were no or even negative performance differences between the groups that did provide JOLs and the groups that did not provide JOLs. This same pattern emerged in the test phase: Although no differences were found between the groups with and without JOLs, the groups that were forced to select moves for restudy outperformed the groups that were free in the number of move selections. These data show that, for novice chess players, the instruction to provide JOLs possibly places a high and ineffective load on working memory and therefore has no effect on learning a chess endgame. To examine the relation between prior knowledge and quality of self-regulation, further research is needed that examines the effect of the JOL and selection instruction in groups that differ in chess experience.",

The main reasons for these limited efforts are probably that empirical user testing with VREs is difficult and timeconsuming and ergonomic rules or criteria and traditional HCI tools and methods are not well suited for VRE. Alternatively, the specification of interaction based on a formal method or notation provides a precise and unambiguous description that can be used to reason the user's actions while interacting with a VRE. In this paper, we propose a new approach to design interaction techniques in VRE, based on the use of a formal specification language: the ASUR notation. In the early stages of system design, time and effort are reduced by assisting the designers in considering alternative solutions and anticipating usability issues. To better explain the proposed methodology, we report an evaluation of selection and manipulation techniques in a virtual environment based on a chess game. The evaluation has been carried out in two ways: predictively, with the help of the ASUR notation, and empirically via user experiments. We present the outcomes of the empirical studies and demonstrate that the reasoning with the ASUR notation leads to similar but also results complementary to those obtained with the experiments.",

This can be convenient for setting up enumeration problems, but we show that other problem genres also lend themselves to composing enumerative problems. Some of the resulting enumerations cannot be shown (or have not yet been shown) in series-movers.",

This commentary reviews how research on expertise originally focused on testing chess experts' memory as a convenient substitute for studies of actual performance, such as selecting the best move for chess positions. Most of the articles in the special issue illustrate a new trend towards capturing the expert performance with representative tasks in the laboratory and focus on how this superior performance is acquired through training and extended deliberate practice. With these and other advances in our knowledge of how experts acquire their superior skills, the study of expertise is establishing its most important implications for theoretical and applied cognitive psychology.",

In this context games can be seen as a way of securely reducing (segmenting) real-world complexity, thus creating the laboratory environment necessary for testing the diverse types and facets of intelligence produced by computer models. This paper aims to promote the belief that games represent an excellent tool for the project of computational psychology (CP).",
      "458": "Deterioration rates are estimated using record bests by age for chess and for various track and field, road running, and swimming events. Using a fairly flexible functional form, the estimates show linear percent deterioration between age 35 and about age 70 and then quadratic deterioration after that. Chess shows much less deterioration than the physical activities. Deterioration rates are generally larger for the longer distances, and for swimming they are larger for women than for men. An advantage of using best-performance records to estimated deterioration rates is that they are generally based on very large samples. In addition, the age range is large. In this study the age range is 35-100 for swimming, 35-98 for track and field and running, and 35-94 for chess. The estimates also do not suffer from traditional forms of selection bias.",

A series of 12 games (6 white, 6 black) was played against PF2 using the best chess program that resulted from 50 generations of variation and selection in self-play. The results yielded 9 wins, 2 losses, and 1 draw for the evolved program. This paper reports on further evolution of the best-evolved chess program, executed through 7462 generations. Results show that the outcome of this subsequent evolution was statistically significantly better than the prior player from 50 generations. A 16-game series against PF2, which plays with the rating of a high-level master, resulted in 13 wins, 0 losses, and 3 draws, yielding a performance rating of approximately 2650.",

Workers in AI have always denied that this interest was more than purely accidental. Parlor games, they claimed, became a favorite topic of interest because they provided the ideal test case for any simulation of intelligence. Chess is the Drosophila of AI, it was said, with reference to the fruit-fly whose fast reproductive cycle made it into a favorite test bed for genetic theories for almost a century. In this paper I will try to show Artificial Intelligence's relationship to games is quite different from what this analogy suggests. In fact, I will argue that AI is, at core, a theory of games and a theory of subjectivity as game-playing.",

      "469": "An important aspect of paired comparison experiments is the decision of how to form pairs in advance of collecting data. A weakness of typical paired comparison experimental designs is the di culty in incorporating prior information, which can be particularly relevant for the design of tournament schedules for players of games and sports. Pairing methods that make use of prior information are often ad hoc algorithms with little or no formal basis. The problem of pairing objects can be formalized as a Bayesian optimal design. Assuming a linear paired comparison model for outcomes, we develop a pairing method that maximizes the expected gain in Kullback-Leibler information from the prior to the posterior distribution. The optimal pairing is determined using a combinatorial optimization method commonly used in graph-theoretic contexts. We discuss the properties of our optimal pairing criterion, and demonstrate our method as an adaptive procedure for pairing objects multiple times. We compare the performance of our method on simulated data against random pairings, and against a system that is currently in use in tournament chess.",

      "480": "This paper introduces the idea of pre-searching a position-searching it before \u03b1\u03b2 determines that it needs to be searched. Consider the case where an iteration of \u03b1\u03b2 search comes across a position p that needs to be searched to depth d1, and the transposition table reveals that p will likely need to be searched later in that iteration to depth d2 greater than d1. Pre-searching involves speculatively searching p to depth d2, even though it has not been demonstrated that search to this depth is needed. If the gamble is successful, then additional accuracy is introduced to the search (using a result with extra search depth d2 -d1). While any search extension scheme is not without some risk, empirical results indicate that the impact on the \u03b1\u03b2 search tree size is small, but the additional accuracy that is introduced improves program performance.",
      "485": "Rising population intelligence should be impacting in the real world and performance in intellectual games such as chess may be good indices of such impact. Previous research suggests that chess players recently have been reaching high performance levels at younger and younger ages, consistent with rising population ability, but this conclusion is based on very limited data. Sample size was small and data mostly were only from 1970. The present study was able to use all international chess rating list data and some new data back to 1880 to investigate this issue thoroughly. Longitudinal data show that the age effect really is something quite new, not being apparent before 1970. The age effect mostly is occurring in the very top players, who are getting on the list at progressively younger ages, but also is occurring in female players, though not as strongly. The age effect mainly seems due to progressively more very talented young players entering the rating list very young and quickly rising. The data also allow some other interpretations of the age effect to be partly excluded. Top players do not seem to be getting any more practice and the peak rating age still seems to be around 35 years old, as it has been for many decades. The effect thus is unlikely to be due to recent changes in the chess environment. The best interpretation is that the natural talent pool has greatly improved in recent years, consistent with rising population ability.",
      "486": "Males traditionally predominate at upper achievement levels. One general view holds that this is due only to various social factors such as the 'glass ceiling' and lack of female role models. Another view holds that it occurs partly because of innate ability differences, with more males being at upper ability levels. In the last few decades, women have become more achievement focused and competitive and have gained many more opportunities to achieve. The present study examined one intellectual domain, international chess, to quantify its gender differences in achievement and to see if these have been diminishing with the societal changes. Chess is a good test domain because it is a meritocracy, it has objective performance measures, and longitudinal data of a whole population are available. Performance ratings overall and in the top 10, 50 and 100 players of each sex show large gender differences and little convergence over the past three decades, although a few females have become high achievers. The distribution of performance ratings on the January 2004 list shows a higher male mean and evidence for more male variation, just as with traits such as height. Career patterns of players first on the list between 1985 and 1989 show that top males and females entered the list at about the same age but females tend to play fewer games and have shorter careers. In this domain at least, the male predominance is large and has remained roughly constant despite societal changes.",

A priority is placed on maintaining the flexibility necessary to learn new domains with only negligible manual configuration. We found during testing that the current approach to ACE with a reliance on experience and exploration, while quite capable in the domain of checkers, did not perform adequately in the exponentially more complex domain of chess. Our results suggest that experience alone, without the ability to adapt for case differences between new and prior cases, is insufficient in more complex domains.",

For our analysis we used FRITZ 8 and JUNIOR 9 as representative chess search engines and the POWERBOOK opening book as representing human choices. We collected the top-5 ranked moves and their scores as reported by FRITZ and JUNIOR, after 15 and 30 minutes of thinking time, and the top-5 moves recorded in the POWERBOOK, for the Nunn2 test positions and the initial board position. The data analysis was carried out using several nonparametric measures, including the amount of overlap in the top-5 choices of the engines and their association as measured by three variants of Spearman's footrule. Our preliminary results show that, overall, the engines differ substantially in their choice of moves, and, furthermore, the engines' choices also differ substantially from human choice.",

      "503": "The well-known game of chess has traditionally been modeled in artificial intelligence studies by search engines with advanced pruning techniques. The models were thus centered on an inference engine manipulating passive symbols in the form of tokens. It is beyond doubt, however, that human players do not carry out such processes. Instead, chess masters instead carry out perceptual processes, carefully categorizing the chunks perceived in a position and gradually building complex dynamic structures to represent the subtle pressures embedded in the positions. In this paper we will consider two hypotheses concerning the underlying subcognitive processes and architecture. In the first hypothesis, a multiple-leveled chess representational structure is presented, which includes distance graphs (with varying levels of quality) between pieces, piece mobilities, and abstract roles. These representational schemes seem to account for numerous characteristics of human player's psychology. The second hypothesis concerns the extension of the architecture proposed in the Copycat project as central for modeling the emergent intuitive perception of a chess position. We provide a synthesis on how the postulated architecture models chess intuition as an emergent mixture of simultaneous distance estimations, chunk perceptions, abstract role awareness, and intention activations. This is an alternative model to the traditional AI approaches, focusing on the philosophy of active symbols.",

The efforts were mainly driven by the fascination of special competitions like Deep Blue vs. Kasparov, and of the beauty of parlor games like Checkers, Backgammon, Othello and Go. Multi-player games, however, have been inspected by far less, and although literature of game theory fills books about equilibrium-strategies in such games, practical experiences are rare. Korf, Sturtevant and a few others started highly interesting research activities. We have started investigating a four-person chess variant, in order to understand the peculiarities of multi player games without chance components. In this contribution, we present player models and search algorithms that we tested in the four-player chess world. As a result, we can say that the more successful player models can benefit from more efficient algorithms and speed, because searching deeper leads to better results. Moreover, we present a meta-strategy, which beats a paranoid alphabeta player, the best known player in multi player games.",
      "506": "In game-playing programs relying on the minimax principle, deeper searches generally produce better evaluations. Theoretical analyses, however, suggest that in many cases minimaxing amplifies the noise introduced by the heuristic function used to evaluate the leaves of the game tree, leading to what is known as pathological behavior, where deeper searches produce worse evaluations. In most of the previous research, positions were evaluated as losses or wins. Dependence between the values of positions close to each other was identified as the property of realistic game trees that eliminates the pathology and explains why minimax is successful in practice. In this paper we present an alternative explanation that does not rely on value dependence. We show that if real numbers are used for position values, position values tend to be further apart at lower levels of the game tree, which leads to a larger proportion of more extreme positions, where error is less probable. Decreased probability of error in searches to greater depths is sufficient to eliminate the pathology and no additional properties of game trees are required.",
      "511": "Nowadays, designers of Virtual Reality (VR) applications are faced with the choice of a large number of different input and output devices leading to a growing number of interaction techniques. Usually VR interaction techniques are described informally, based on the actions users can perform within the VR environment. At implementation time, such informal descriptions (made at design time) yield to ambiguous interpretations by the developers. In addition, informal descriptions make it difficult to foresee the impact throughout the application of a modification of the interaction techniques. This paper discusses the advantages of using a formal description technique (called ICO) to model interaction techniques and dialogues for VR applications. This notation is presented via a case study featuring an immersive VR application. The case study is then used to show, through analysis of models, how the formal notation can help to ensure the usability, reliability and efficiency of virtual reality systems.",

Implementations have side effects due to the implementing medium; these can account for several puzzles surrounding qualia. Finally, a benign argument for panpsychism is developed.",
      "521": "This article presents the results of experiments designed to gain insight into the effect of the minimax algorithm on the error of a heuristic evaluation function. Two types of effect of minimax are considered: (a) evaluation accuracy (Are the minimax backed-up values more accurate than the heuristic values themselves?), and (b) decision accuracy (Are moves played by deeper minimax search better than those by shallower search?). The experiments were performed in the King-Rook-King (KRK) chess endgame and in randomly generated game trees. The results show that, counter-intuitively, evaluation accuracy may decline with search depth, whereas at the same time decision accuracy improves with depth. In the article, this is explained by the fact that minimax in combination with a noisy evaluation function introduces a bias into the backed-up evaluations, which masks the evaluation effectiveness of minimax, but this bias still permits decision accuracy to improve with depth. This observed behaviour of minimax in the KRK endgame is discussed in the light of previous studies of pathology in minimax. It is shown that explaining the behaviour of minimax in an actual chess endgame in terms of previously known results requires special care.",

      "525": "We have modified the rules of chess to create a game of imperfect information. By introducing hidden pieces into the game, we have been able to gauge the effect of uncertainty on playing strength. The addition of a hidden white piece led to white winning between 63%-89% of its games. The advantage gained from an invisible piece is dependent on both the type of piece that is hidden, and the search depth at which games are played. Greater search depths increase the value of hidden pieces, although diminishing returns were noted at increased depths. The advantage of a hidden piece is typically greater than the effect of an equivalent extra piece. In this sense, information superiority gained via stealth is a more powerful advantage than additional material. The results indicate that uncertainty arising from hidden pieces profoundly influences outcomes in the game of chess.",

Data were gathered from a sample of participants for whom approaches to risk were likely to vary (academics, chess players, firefighters, mountaineers and City traders). The results showed that participants could be categorised into two groups: those who were consistent in their risk preferences in three decision domains, and those who were inconsistent or domain-specific. The consistent group was significantly lower on neuroticism and higher on agreeableness and conscientiousness with a less variable approach to weighing up the costs and benefits of taking risks than the inconsistent group. The majority of the consistent group was risk averse.",

      "534": "A promising approach to learn to play board games is to use reinforcement learning algorithms that can learn a game position evaluation function. In this paper we examine and compare three different methods for generating training games: (1) Learning by self-play, (2) Learning by playing against an expert program, and (3) Learning from viewing experts play against themselves. Although the third possibility generates highquality games from the start compared to initial random games generated by self-play, the drawback is that the learning program is never allowed to test moves which it prefers. We compared these three methods using temporal difference methods to learn the game of backgammon. For particular games such as draughts and chess, learning from a large database containing games played by human experts has as a large advantage that during the generation of (useful) training games, no expensive lookahead planning is necessary for move selection. Experimental results in this paper show how useful this method is for learning to play chess and draughts.",

      "540": "Gamma-band activity (GBA) bursts have been viewed as a signature for ignitions in localized Hebbian cell assemblies and are thought to indicate active memory. Using whole-head magnetoencephalography, we recorded focal bursts of GBA during chess playing. Unlike highly skilled chess grandmasters, with amateur chess players focal gamma bursts prevailed in deeper structures in the region of the medial temporal lobes. This observation is consistent with the interpretation of memory formation in amateur chess players. For the frontal and parietal cortex the relationship was reversed, with more frequent gamma bursts found in chess grandmasters, indicating that the retrieval of chunks from expert memory is based on the recruitment of these neocortical areas. The results suggest the possibility that time-dependent reorganization during the formation of expert memory can be studied in humans and support the theory that the medial temporal lobe and hippocampal formation play a transitional role during the creation of expert memory in the neocortex.",

The tuning of the evaluation function has been implemented using only final outcomes of games. Each individual of the population represents a chess program with specific (different) parameters of its evaluation function. The principal objective is to ascertain fitness values of individuals in order to promote them into successive generations. This is achieved by competition between individuals of two populations which also changes the individuals of both populations. The preliminary results show that less generations are necessary to obtain good (tuned) parameters. Acquired results have exhibited the fact that population individuals (vectors) are not as diverse as they would be if no changes were made during the competition.",

The gesture, speech and multimodal behaviours of 20 subjects are detailed. The multimodal oral with gesture large display interface (MOWGLI) is then described. It is an oral and gesture multimodal human-computer interface, allowing users interacting remotely in real time. Continuous pointing direction and other hand discrete selection gestures are recognized by computer vision tracking of user's head and hands. Associating gesture recognition with speech recognition of selection and deselection oral commands, MOWGLI behaves as a virtual contactless, application independent, multimodal mouse. Discrete pointing locations corresponding to discrete speech or gesture selection time events are extracted from the continuous pointing process. A large vocabulary related to a chess game application allows shorter and specific multimodal commands such as pointing at desired location htherei and uttering a piece move oral command without needing a previous pointing gesture to another piece location, whereas generic ''Put that there'' commands need two successive pointing locations (hthati and htherei). Contextual constraints such as displacement rules of pieces and current game position allow interpretation of ambiguous commands and lead to shorter multimodal commands.",

Heuristics to more effectively manage time were developed by trial and error, play testing against Fritz 8.0. The best heuristics discovered were different for black and white. The results of 12 games played on each side were 1 win, 4 losses, and 7 draws for black, and 2 wins, 6 losses, and 4 draws for white.

This tendency of computer play has been criticized since it differs much from emulating human thoughts which once was one of the primary goals of computer game playing. An alternative way which is much closer to human game playing, is to discover rules automatically for a given game with the aid of Artificial-Intelligence techniques and human thought. Obtaining such rules can be done by building computer game programs. This research line may have a much broader scope (1) to understand better the ideas of a certain game, (2) to investigate how to build automatically learnt policies for a planning problem, and perhaps even (3) to understand a bit better human thinking. To illustrate these three points, we use a small game, that could be called King Race, and we aim at discovering rules to solve it. To discover these rules we use some human thought and a decision tree program. Then we prove mathematically that these automatically obtained rules indeed solve the game. The rules can aid in building computer-chess endgame programs that do not use brute force.",

      "577": "Superior cognitive performance can be viewed from an intelligence perspective, emphasising general properties of the human information processing system (such as mental speed and working memory), and from an expertise perspective, highlighting the indispensable role of elaborated domain-specific knowledge and acquired skills. In exploring its neurophysiological basis, recent research has provided considerable evidence of the neural efficiency hypothesis of intelligence, indicating lower and more focussed brain activation in brighter individuals. The present EEG study investigates the impacts of intelligence and expertise on cognitive performance and the accompanying cortical activation patterns in the domain of tournament chess. Forty-seven tournament chess players of varying intelligence and expertise level worked on tasks drawing on mental speed, memory, and reasoning. Half of the tasks were representative for chess, while the other half was not. The cortical activation was quantified by means of event-related desynchronisation (ERD) in the upper alpha band. Independent effects of expertise and intelligence emerged at both, the performance and the neurophysiological level. Brighter participants performed better than less intelligent ones which was associated with more efficient brain functioning (lower ERD) across all tasks. Additionally, a high expertise level was beneficial for good task performance but exerted a topographically differentiated influence on the cortical activation patterns. The findings suggest that superior cognitive performance and the underlying cortical activation are not only a function of knowledge and domain-specific competences but also of the general efficiency of the information processing system.",
      "578": "Starting from controversies over the role of general individual characteristics (especially intelligence) for the attainment of expert performance levels, a comprehensive psychometric investigation of individual diVerences in chess expertise is presented. A sample of 90 adult tournament chess players of varying playing strengths (1311-2387 ELO) was screened with tests on intelligence and personality variables; in addition, experience in chess play, tournament participation, and practice activities were assessed. Correlation and regression analyses revealed a clear-cut moderate relationship between general (and in particular numerical) intelligence and the participants' playing strengths, suggesting that expert chess play does not stand in isolation from superior mental abilities. The strongest predictor of the attained expertise level, however, was the participants' chess experience which highlights the relevance of long-term engagement for the development of expertise. Among all analysed personality dimensions, only domain-speciWc performance motivation and emotion expression control incrementally contributed to the prediction of playing strength. In total, measures of chess experience, current tournament activity, intelligence, and personality accounted for about 55% of variance in chess expertise. The present results suggest that individual diVerences in chess expertise are multifaceted and cannot be reduced to diVerences in domain experience.",

Chase and Simon introduced the concept of chunking to explain why expert chess players perform so well in memory tasks. Chunking is the process of dividing a chess position into smaller parts that have meaning. We performed similar experiments in Shogi with a set of next-move problem positions, collecting verbal protocol data and eye-movement data. Even though experiments in Chess indicated that expert chess players searched as wide and deep as non-expert players, our experiments show that expert Shogi players search more moves, search deeper and search faster than non-expert players. Our experiments also show that expert Shogi players cannot only memorize the patterns of the positions but also recognize move sequences before and after the position. The results suggest that other than the perceptual spatial chunks introduced in chess research, there are also chunks of meaningful move sequences. We call such chunks \"temporal chunk\". Our research indicates that Shogi players become stronger by acquiring these temporal chunks.",

Removing the 2-player restriction allows multiple equilibria and other complex strategic interactions that require the full tool set of game theory. The major challenge for applying game theoretic methods to such a large game is to identify a tractable subset of the game for detailed analysis that captures the essence of the strategic interactions. We argue that the notion of strategic independence holds significant promise for scaling game theory to large games. We present preliminary results based on data from two sets of strategies for chaturanga. These results suggest that strategic independence is present in chaturanga, and demonstrate some possible ways to exploit it.",

      "619": "Deeper searches in game-playing programs relying on the minimax principle generally produce better results. Theoretical analyses, however, suggest that in many cases minimaxing amplifies the noise introduced by the heuristic function used to evaluate the leaves of the game tree, leading to what is known as pathological behavior, where deeper searches produce worse results. In most minimax models analyzed in previous research, positions' true values and sometimes also heuristic values were only losses and wins. In contrast to this, a model is proposed in this paper that uses real numbers for both true and heuristic values. This model did not behave pathologically in the experiments performed. The mechanism that causes deeper searches to produce better evaluations is explained. A comparison with chess is made, indicating that the model realistically reflects position evaluations in chess-playing programs. Conditions under which the pathology might appear in a real-value model are also examined. The essential difference between our real-value model and the common two-value model, which causes the pathology in the two-value model, is identified. Most previous research reports that the pathology tends to disappear when there are dependences between the values of sibling nodes in a game tree. In this paper, another explanation is presented which indicates that in the two-value models the error of the heuristic evaluation was not modeled realistically.",

In particular, we examine whether players from the former Soviet Union acted as a cartel in international tournaments --intentionally drawing against one another in order to focus effort on non-Soviet opponents --to maximize the chance of some Soviet winning. Using data from international qualifying tournaments as well as USSR national tournaments, we estimate models to test for collusion. Our results are consistent with Soviet draw-collusion and inconsistent with Soviet competition. Simulations of the period's five premier international competitions (the FIDE Candidates tournaments) suggest that the observed Soviet sweep was a 75%-probability event under collusion but only a 25%-probability event had the Soviet players not colluded.",

Observed-Action Reasoning is the problem of reasoning about the world state after a sequence of partial observations of actions and states. In this paper we formalize Observed-Action Reasoning, prove intractability results for current techniques, and find tractable algorithms for STRIPS and other actions. Our new algorithms update a representation of all possible world states (the belief state) in logic using new logical constants for unknown objects. A straightforward application of this idea is incorrect, and we identify and add two key amendments. We also present successful experimental results for our algorithm in Blocks-world domains of varying sizes and in Kriegspiel (partially observable chess). These results are promising for relating sensors with symbols, partial-knowledge games, multi-agent decision making, and AI planning.",

Leading on from this background material we will show that analysing the patterns of interconnections between agents can be used to detect dominance relationships. Another important aspect of social order is the enforcement of social norms. By coupling network theory, game theory and evolutionary algorithms, we will examine the role that social networks (the structure of the interactions between agents) play in the emergence of social norms.

All standard equilibrium concepts dictate that the player who decides first must stop the game immediately. There is vast experimental evidence, however, that this rarely occurs.

Our experimental tests in the game of kriegspiel chess (an imperfect-information variant of chess) produced surprising results: (1) against each other, and against one of the kriegspiel algorithms presented at IJCAI-05, the overconfident model usually outperformed the paranoid model; (2) the performance of both models depended greatly on how well the model corresponded to the opponent's behavior.

We propose a method for automatically dividing the endgame into stages characterised by different objectives of play. For each stage of such a game plan, a stagespecific evaluation function is induced, to be used by minimax search when playing the endgame.

We compared planning performance between chess ( N \u00bc 25) and non-chess players ( N \u00bc 25) using a standard psychometric planning task, the Tower of London (ToL) test. We also assessed fluid intelligence (Raven Test), as well as verbal and visuospatial working memory. As expected, chess players showed better planning performance than non-chess players, an effect most strongly expressed in difficult problems. On the other hand, they showed longer planning and movement execution times, especially for incorrectly solved trials. No differences in fluid intelligence and verbal/visuospatial working memory were found between both groups. These findings indicate that better performance in chess players is associated with disproportionally longer solution times, although it remains to be investigated whether motivational or strategic differences account for this result.",

However, the same rule has to be violated three times in a row, i.e., in three consecutive loops, in order to lose a game. Therefore, a player can violate different rules in three cycles and still achieve a draw. In contrast, Westernchess rules always define a game as a draw after three consecutive loops.

Finally, in the test phase, participants had to play the endgame against the computer and were required to checkmate the opponent King. Apart from their test performance, the conditions were compared on quality of move predictions in the learning phase. The self-explanation condition showed better understanding of the endgame principles than the two other conditions, as indicated by the move predictions in the learning phase that more often exemplified correct application of chess principles. Moreover, participants in the self-explanation condition more often checkmated the black King in the test phase than participants in the two other conditions.

The use of archival data enabled us to track the rating of some of the players throughout their career. We found that there was a strong correlation between chess skill and number of hours of practice. Moreover, group practice was a better predictor of high-level performance than individual practice. We also found that masters had a higher chess rating than expert players after only three years of serious dedication to chess, although there were no differences in the number of hours of practice. The difference that may explain the variation in rating is that masters start practising at an earlier age than experts. Finally, we found that activities such as reading books and using computer software (game databases, but not playing programs) were important for the development of high-level performance. Together with previous data and theories of expert performance, our results indicate limits in the deliberate practice framework and make suggestions on how best to carry out learning in chess and in other fields.",

A sample of 90 adult tournament chess players of varying playing strengths (1311-2387 ELO) was screened with tests on intelligence and personality variables; in addition, experience in chess play, tournament participation, and practice activities were assessed. Correlation and regression analyses revealed a clear-cut moderate relationship between general (and in particular numerical) intelligence and the participants' playing strengths, suggesting that expert chess play does not stand in isolation from superior mental abilities. The strongest predictor of the attained expertise level, however, was the participants' chess experience which highlights the relevance of long-term engagement for the development of expertise. Among all analysed personality dimensions, only domain-speciWc performance motivation and emotion expression control incrementally contributed to the prediction of playing strength. In total, measures of chess experience, current tournament activity, intelligence, and personality accounted for about 55% of variance in chess expertise. The present results suggest that individual diVerences in chess expertise are multifaceted and cannot be reduced to diVerences in domain experience.",
      "696": "The phenomenon of diminishing returns for additional search effort has been observed by several researchers. We study experimentally additional factors which influence the behaviour of diminishing returns that manifest themselves in go-deep experiments. The results obtained on a large set of more than 40,000 positions from chess grandmaster games using the programs CRAFTY, RYBKA, and SHREDDER show that diminishing returns depend on (a) the values of the positions, (b) the quality of the evaluation function of the program used, and to some extent also on (c) the phase of the game, and the amount of material on the board.",
      "698": "We propose an approach for developing efficient search algorithms through genetic programming. Focusing on the game of chess we evolve entire game-tree search algorithms to solve the Mate-In-N problem: find a key move such that even with the best possible counterplays, the opponent cannot avoid being mated in (or before) move N . We show that our evolved search algorithms successfully solve several instances of the Mate-In-N problem, for the hardest ones developing 47% less gametree nodes than CRAFTY-a state-of-the-art chess engine with a ranking of 2614 points. Improvement is thus not over the basic alpha-beta algorithm, but over a world-class program using all standard enhancements.",
      "700": "A zero-sum perfect information game is one where every player knows all the moves. Chess is a good example where the object is to checkmate or capture the enemy king. One important feature of checkmates, especially in chess problem composition, is economy. This paper proposes a computational function to evaluate the economy of checkmate configurations on the chessboard. Several experiments were performed comparing chess compositions and regular games to validate the function. The results suggest that the proposed evaluation function is able to correctly discern economical differences in checkmate positions to a high degree of statistical significance and correlates positively with the perception of human chess players. This evaluation function can therefore be useful in increasing the versatility of chess database search engines, as a component in aesthetic models of chess and aiding judges in chess composition tournaments.",

A cumulative strength metric applies to each square controlled by a piece. The computer model, Relative Strength (RS), predicts the next move in an opening example from the world computer chess championship. A predictive rate is significant. RS is a teaching aid for recognition of tactical chess patterns based on positional patterns. From implementation of RS, recent advances in external computer storage of chess positions include invention of the radix hash sort.",
      "706": "In this paper a strategy planning procedure for a class of chess endgames is given. The class of chess endgames considered are those chess games that are built around a Zugzwang, are just formed by pawns and, whose configuration can be decomposed as a sum of independent subgames restricted to belong to one of the following cases: i) Zero or fuzzy games, and ii) Positive or negative games where the winner has the possibility of driving the game to case (i). In addition some tempos are allowed. The main contribution consists in giving a strategy plan procedure of how a chess player checkmates or draws knowing that he is in a winning position using combinatorial game mathematical tools. By a winning position in a game it is understood a position where one of the players makes the last move in that game and as a consequence forces his opponent to start playing in the next game and so on, until at the end plays first in the Zugzwang and draws or loses the chess game.",

It starts out from an understanding of games as entities in which the impulse to play is inextricably linked to the desire to cheat, as the close etymological kinship of the Latin terms ludo (I play) and deludo (I cheat) suggests. Therefore, it can be argued that, in order to understand a game, one must play not only by its rules but also with its rules. This will be demonstrated using examples drawn from my own games research experience, addressing the ethical, methodological and epistemological implications of this practice.",
      "709": "The opening book is an important component of a chess engine, and thus computer chess programmers have been developing automated methods to improve the quality of their books. For chess, which has a very rich opening theory, large databases of high-quality games can be used as the basis of an opening book, from which statistics relating to move choices from given positions can be collected. In order to find out whether the opening books used by modern chess engines in machine versus machine competitions are 'comparable' to those used by chess players in human versus human competitions, we carried out analysis on 26 test positions using statistics from two opening books: one compiled from humans' games and the other from machines' games. Our analysis using several nonparametric measures shows that, overall, there is a strong association between humans' and machines' choices of opening moves when using a book to guide their choices.",

Such programs have a sufficient understanding of how to play these games well, to enable them to teach weaker players how to improve their own skills, yet little has thus far been accomplished in this field. Here we describe an important step on the road to a World Champion calibre tutor program. The example used in this paper is Chess, but the general ideas discussed here are equally applicable to other games. The paper discusses many of the typical situations of interest that a strong human Chess player employs when teaching pupils how to improve. For each type of situation of interest some guidelines are presented to indicate how a computer program could identify such situations. This task is comparable to that of writing an annotation program, able to comment on a Chess game in the style employed in books, newspaper columns and magazines. A state-of-the-art example is presented of a game annotated by a World Champion calibre Chess program.",
      "711": "There is a crucial debate concerning the nature of chess chunks: One current possibility states that chunks are built by encoding particular combinations of pieces-on-squares (POSs), and that chunks are formed mostly by \"close\" pieces (in a \"Euclidean\" sense). A complementary hypothesis is that chunks are encoded by abstract, semantic information. This article extends recent experiments and shows that chess players are able to perceive strong similarity between very different positions if the pieces retain the same abstract roles in both of them. This casts doubt on the idea that POS information is the key information encoded in chess chunks, and this article proposes, instead, that the key encoding involves the abstract roles that pieces (and sets of pieces) play-a theoretical standpoint in line with the research program in semantics that places analogy at the core of cognition.",

In this paper it is argued that gender stereotypes are mainly responsible for the underperformance of women in chess. Forty-two male-female pairs, matched for ability, played two chess games via Internet. When players were unaware of the sex of opponent (control condition), females played approximately as well as males. When the gender stereotype was activated (experimental condition), women showed a drastic performance drop, but only when they were aware that they were playing against a male opponent. When they (falsely) believed to be playing against a woman, they performed as well as their male opponents. In addition, our findings suggest that women show lower chess-specific self-esteem and a weaker promotion focus, which are predictive of poorer chess performance.",

This paper explores the application of coevolutionary models to learn Chinese Chess strategies. The proposed Chinese Chess engine uses alpha-beta search algorithm, quiescence search and move ordering. Three different models are studied: single-population competitive, hostparasite competitive and cooperative coevolutionary models. A modified alpha-beta algorithm is also developed for performance evaluation and an archiving mechanism is implemented to handle intransitive behaviour. Interesting traits are revealed when the coevolution models are simulated under different settings -with and without opening book. Results show that the coevolved players can perform relatively well, with the cooperative model being best for finding good players under random strategy initialization and the host-parasite model being best for the case when strategies are initialized with a good set of starting seeds.",

The interface allows users to play the games through a set of physical tokens on an interactive board.

The proposed technique uses only one central six-axis force-torque sensor embedded beneath the playing board.",
      "717": "Game artificial intelligence (AI) controls the decision-making process of computer-controlled opponents in computer games. Adaptive game AI (i.e., game AI that can automatically adapt the behaviour of the computer players to changes in the environment) can increase the entertainment value of computer games. Successful adaptive game AI is invariably based on the game's domain knowledge. We show that an offline evolutionary algorithm can learn important domain knowledge in the form of game tactics (i.e., a sequence of game actions) for dynamic scripting, an offline algorithm inspired by reinforcement learning approaches that we use to create adaptive game AI. We compare the performance of dynamic scripting under three conditions for defeating nonadaptive opponents in a real-time strategy game. In the first condition, we manually encode its tactics. In the second condition, we manually translate the tactics learned by the evolutionary algorithm, and use them for dynamic scripting. In the third condition, this translation is automated. We found that dynamic scripting performs best under the third condition, and both of the latter conditions outperform manual tactic encoding. We discuss the implications of these results, and the performance of dynamic scripting for adaptive game AI from the perspective of machine learning research and commercial game development.",
      "718": "The authors examined longitudinal change in chess skill using a multilevel model analysis of a large database of active, elite chess players (N \u03ed 5,011). Parameters estimated from quadratic growth curves indicated that the age of peak performance occurs later in life than originally proposed and that this peak is independent of initial skill level. The findings are also consistent with the hypothesis that aging is slightly kinder to the initially more able, who show milder decline past their peak. Higher tournament activity levels predicted higher ratings overall and interacted with age in the initially more able sample, suggesting that activity had smaller effects on rating for older adults. The authors discuss implications of these findings for lifetime changes in skilled performance.",

The main component of a chess engine is board evaluation function. In this article we present a new method to solve chess endgames optimally without using Brute-Force algorithms or endgame tables. We propose to use Artificial Neural Network to obtain better evaluation function for endgame positions. This method is specifically applied to three classical endgames: King-Bishop-Bishop-King, King-Rook-King, and King-Queen-King. The empirical results show that the proposed learning strategy is effective in wining against an opponent who offers its best survival defense using Nalimov database of best endgame moves.",
      "721": "Chess and chance are seemingly strange bedfellows. Luck and/or randomness have no apparent role in move selection when the game is played at the highest levels. However, when competition is at the ultimate level, that of the World Chess Championship (WCC), chess and conspiracy are not strange bedfellows, there being a long and colorful history of accusations levied between participants. One such accusation, frequently repeated, was that all the games in the 1985 WCC (Karpov vs Kasparov) were fixed and prearranged move by move. That this claim was advanced by a former World Champion, Bobby Fischer, argues that it ought be investigated. That the only published, concrete basis for this claim consists of an observed run of particular moves, allows this investigation to be performed using probabilistic and statistical methods. In particular, we employ imbedded finite Markov chains to evaluate run statistic distributions. Further, we demonstrate how both chess computers and game data bases can be brought to bear on the problem.",

This paper has a twofold objective: first, to review our recent results of applying genetic programming in the domain of games; second, to formulate the merits of genetic programming in acting as a tool for developing strategies in general, and to discuss the possible design of a strategizing machine.",

      "731": "The present study was designed to test the effect of self-explanation and prediction on the development of principled understanding of novices learning to play chess. First-year psychology students, who had no chess experience, first learned the basic rules of chess and were afterwards divided in three conditions. They either observed (control condition), predicted, or predicted and self-explained the moves of the computer playing a chess endgame of King and Rook against King. Finally, in the test phase, participants had to play the endgame against the computer and were required to checkmate the opponent King. Apart from their test performance, the conditions were compared on quality of move predictions in the learning phase. The self-explanation condition showed better understanding of the endgame principles than the two other conditions, as indicated by the move predictions in the learning phase that more often exemplified correct application of chess principles. Moreover, participants in the self-explanation condition more often checkmated the black King in the test phase than participants in the two other conditions. However, no differences emerged between the prediction and observation condition. This study showed that, even for novices, providing self-explanations stimulates the discovery of domain principles of chess.",
      "732": "The ability to play chess is generally assumed to depend on two types of processes: slow processes such as search, and fast processes such as pattern recognition. It has been argued that an increase in time pressure during a game selectively hinders the ability to engage in slow processes. Here we study the eVect of time pressure on expert chess performance in order to test the hypothesis that compared to weak players, strong players depend relatively heavily on fast processes. In the Wrst study we examine the performance of players of various strengths at an online chess server, for games played under diVerent time controls. In a second study we examine the eVect of time controls on performance in world championship matches. Both studies consistently show that skill diVerences between players become less predictive of the game outcome as the time controls are tightened. This result indicates that slow processes are at least as important for strong players as they are for weak players.

One possibility, loosely originating in research on creativity and skill acquisition, is that an increase in expertise can lead to inflexibility of thought due to automation of procedures. Yet another possibility, based on expertise research, is that experts' knowledge leads to flexibility of thought. We tested these two possibilities in a series of experiments using the Einstellung (set) effect paradigm. Chess players tried to solve problems that had both a familiar but non-optimal solution and a better but less familiar one. The more familiar solution induced the Einstellung (set) effect even in experts, preventing them from finding the optimal solution. The presence of the non-optimal solution reduced experts' problem solving ability was reduced to about that of players three standard deviations lower in skill level by the presence of the non-optimal solution. Inflexibility of thought induced by prior knowledge (i.e., the blocking effect of the familiar solution) was shown by experts but the more expert they were, the less prone they were to the effect. Inflexibility of experts is both reality and myth. But the greater the level of expertise, the more of a myth it becomes.",

Our chess engine proved that reinforcement learning in combination with the classification of board state leads to a notable improvement, when compared with other engines that only use reinforcement learning, such as KnightCap. We extended KnightCap's learning algorithm by using a bigger and more complete board state database, and adjusting and optimizing the coefficients for each position class individually. A clear enhancement of our engine's learning and playing skills is reached after only a few trained games.",

For example, real-world scene contexts give rise to larger search benefits than contexts composed of letters or shapes. We investigated whether such differences in learning can be at least partially explained by the degree of semantic meaning associated with a context independently of the nature of the visual information available (which also varies across stimulus types). Chess boards served as the learning context as their meaningfulness depends on the observer's knowledge of the game. In Experiment 1, boards depicted actual game play, and search benefits for repeated boards were 4 times greater for experts than for novices. In Experiment 2, search benefits among experts were halved when less meaningful randomly generated boards were used. Thus, stimulus meaningfulness independently contributes to learning contexttarget associations.",

      "758": "Since Chase and Simon presented their influential paper on perception in chess in 1973, the use of chunks has become the subject of a number of studies into the cognitive behavior of human game players. However, the nature of chunks has remained elusive, and the reason for this lies in the lack of using a general cognitive theory to explain the nature of chunks. In this paper it will be argued that Marvin Minsky's Society of Mind theory is a good candidate for a cognitive theory to define chunks and to explain the relation between chunks and problemsolving tasks. To use Minsky's Society of Mind theory to model human cognitive behavior in games, we first need to understand more about the primitive agents dealing with the relation between perception and knowledge in memory. To investigate this relation, a reproduction experiment is performed in shogi showing that perception is guided by knowledge in long-term memory. From the results we may conclude that the primitive agents in a cognitive model for game-playing should represent abstract concepts such as board, piece, and king rather than the perceptual features of board and pieces.",

The class of chess endgames considered are those chess games that are built around a tr\u00e9buchet, are just formed by pawns and, whose configuration can be decomposed as a sum of independent subgames restricted to belong to one of the following cases: i) Zero or fuzzy games, and ii) Positive or negative games where the winner has the possibility of driving the game to case (i). In addition some tempos are allowed. The main contribution consists in answering the question of how a chess player checkmates knowing that he is in a winning position using combinatorial game mathematical tools. By a winning position in a game it is understood a position where one of the players makes the last move in that game and as a consequence forces his opponent to start playing in the next game and so on, until at the end plays first in the tr\u00e9buchet and loses the chess game.",

I use Lewis Coser's theory of greedy institutions as a way to analyze how these mechanisms influence player decisions and foster devotion to the game. Inspired largely by Randall Collins, I expand Coser's original framework by analyzing how the ritual of competitive play is structured in ways to heighten the intrinsic rewards of the game and further encourage commitment among the players. As such, devotion in chess is explained as a product of the following organizational elements: (1) isolation from competing social spheres; (2) encapsulation within a symbolic status structure; (3) a collective feeling of elite status; (4) trials of worthiness; and (5) prestructured ritual. After considering how these mechanisms operate in the world of chess, I discuss the potential of this expanded model of greedy institutions for future research across other social contexts.",

While the conventional versions of nullmove pruning use reduction values of R \u2264 3, we use an aggressive reduction value of R = 4 within a verified adaptive configuration which maximizes the benefit from the more aggressive pruning, while limiting its tactical liabilities. Our experimental results using our grandmasterlevel chess program, Falcon, show that our null-move reductions (NMR) outperform the conventional methods, with the tactical benefits of the deeper search dominating the deficiencies. Moreover, unlike standard null-move pruning, which fails badly in zugzwang positions, NMR is impervious to zugzwangs. Finally, the implementation of NMR in any program already using null-move pruning requires a modification of only a few lines of code.",

These results suggest a stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system with no changes in the parasympathetic system. The respiratory exchange ratio was rather elevated (over 0.89) at the start and significantly decreased during the game (0.75 at the end), indicating that energy expenditure progressively switched from carbohydrate to lipid oxidation.

The practice activities and performance ratings of young elite chess players, who were either in, or had dropped out of the Dutch national chess training, were analysed since they had started playing chess seriously. The results revealed that deliberate practice (i.e. serious chess study alone and serious chess play) strongly contributed to chess performance. The influence of deliberate practice was not only observable in current performance, but also over chess players' careers. Moreover, although the drop-outs' chess ratings developed more slowly over time, both the persistent and drop-out chess players benefited to the same extent from investments in deliberate practice. Finally, the effect of gender on chess performance proved to be much smaller than the effect of deliberate practice. This study provides longitudinal support for the monotonic benefits assumption of deliberate practice, by showing that over chess players' careers, deliberate practice has a significant effect on performance, and to the same extent for chess players of different ultimate performance levels. The results of this study are not in line with critique raised against the deliberate practice theory that the factors deliberate practice and talent could be confounded.",

In this paper, we investigate this question and other aspects of the trustworthiness of those results. Our study shows that, at least for pairs of the players whose scores differ significantly, it is not very likely that their relative rankings would change if (1) a stronger chess program was used, or (2) if the program would search more deeply, or (3) larger sets of positions were available for the analysis.

Often neglected in scientific accounts of learning and in instruction, perceptual learning is a fundamental contributor to human expertise and is crucial in domains where humans show remarkable levels of attainment, such as language, chess, music, and mathematics. In Section 2, we give a brief history and discuss the relation of perceptual learning to other forms of learning. We consider in Section 3 several specific phenomena, illustrating the scope and characteristics of perceptual learning, including both discovery and fluency effects. We describe abstract perceptual learning, in which structural relationships are discovered and recognized in novel instances that do not share constituent elements or basic features. In Section 4, we consider primary concepts that have been used to explain and model perceptual learning, including receptive field change, selection, and relational recoding. In Section 5, we consider the scope of perceptual learning, contrasting recent research, focused on simple sensory discriminations, with earlier work that emphasized extraction of invariance from varied instances in more complex tasks. Contrary to some recent views, we argue that perceptual learning should not be confined to changes in early sensory analyzers. Phenomena at various levels, we suggest, can be unified by models that emphasize discovery and selection of relevant information. In a final section, we consider the potential role of perceptual learning in educational settings. Most instruction emphasizes facts and procedures that can be verbalized, whereas expertise depends heavily on implicit pattern recognition and selective extraction skills acquired through perceptual learning. We consider reasons why perceptual learning has not been systematically addressed in traditional instruction, and we describe recent successful efforts to create a technology of perceptual learning in areas such as aviation, mathematics, and medicine. Research in perceptual learning promises to advance scientific accounts of learning, and perceptual learning technology may offer similar promise in improving education.",

Arimaa is a modern board game that can be played with a standard Chess set. However, the rules of the game are not at all like those of Chess. Furthermore, Arimaa was designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible for humans, yet challenging for computers. While all established Arimaa bots use alpha-beta search with a variety of pruning techniques and other heuristics ending in an extensive positional leaf node evaluation, our new bot, Rat, starts with a positional evaluation of the current position. Based on features found in the current positionsupported by pattern matching using a directed position graph -our bot Rat decides which of a given set of plans to follow. The plan then dictates what types of moves can be chosen. This is another major difference from bots that generate \"all\" possible moves for a particular position. Rat is only allowed to generate moves that belong to certain categories. Leaf nodes are evaluated only by a straightforward material evaluation to help avoid moves that lose material. This highly selective search looks, on average, at only 5 moves out of 5,000 to over 40,000 possible moves in a middle game position.",
      "868": "We have studied the physiological consequences of the tension caused by playing chess in 20 male chess players, by following heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory variables. We observed significant increase in the heart rate (75-86 beats/min), in the ratio low frequency (LF)/high frequency (HF) of heart rate variability (1.3-3.0) and also a decrease in mean heart rate variability with no changes in HF throughout the game. These results suggest a stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system with no changes in the parasympathetic system. The respiratory exchange ratio was rather elevated (over 0.89) at the start and significantly decreased during the game (0.75 at the end), indicating that energy expenditure progressively switched from carbohydrate to lipid oxidation. The changes in substrate oxidation and the sympathetic system seem to be due to high cognitive demands and bring new insight into adaptations to mental strain.",
      "869": "In this paper we introduce a new algorithm for updating the parameters of a heuristic evaluation function, by updating the heuristic towards the values computed by an alpha-beta search. Our algorithm differs from previous approaches to learning from search, such as Samuel's checkers player and the TD-Leaf algorithm, in two key ways. First, we update all nodes in the search tree, rather than a single node. Second, we use the outcome of a deep search, instead of the outcome of a subsequent search, as the training signal for the evaluation function. We implemented our algorithm in a chess program Meep, using a linear heuristic function. After initialising its weight vector to small random values, Meep was able to learn high quality weights from self-play alone. When tested online against human opponents, Meep played at a master level, the best performance of any chess program with a heuristic learned entirely from self-play.",

The nature of the variation in aptitudes and exceptional talents across different domains was investigated in a population based twin sample. Self-report data from 1,685 twin pairs (12-24 years) were analyzed for Music, Arts, Writing, Language, Chess, Mathematics, Sports, Memory, and Knowledge. The influence of shared environment was small for both aptitude and talent. Additive and non-additive genetic effects explained the major part of the substantial familial clustering in the aptitude measures with heritability estimates ranging between .32 and .71. Heritability estimates for talents were higher and ranged between .50 and .92. In general, the genetic architecture for aptitude and talent was similar in men and women. Genetic factors contribute to a large extent to variation in aptitude and talent across different domains of intellectual, creative, and sports abilities.",

The routine departure of the commander gives rise to the purpose of this study. A total of 108 participants enabled 36 planning teams of three individuals to be composed. The experimental teamwork task was based on the game chess and used a variety of different technological means to facilitate distributed planning, which were then compared with a collocated planning (face-to-face) condition in an A-B-A design. The results show that broadly comparable levels of performance in some areas are reliant on considerably different processes of team adaptation in others. Performance time and overall workload remained relatively stable, yet the number of chess moves made, time pressure and surprise recall performance were considerably elevated in the distributed planning condition. Overall, it appears that the commander can be kept involved in the planning process even though they are remote from it but with some caveats attached. Relevance to industry: Distributed teamworking is a major component of emerging command and control paradigms variously called Network Enabled Capability (NEC). An important challenge for realising the benefits of NEC is to design technology to support distributed teamworking in such a way that it is not merely technically effective but jointly optimised.",

Some recent developments in graphics including OpenGL Shading Language ( GLSL ), shadow casting, and texture mapping are used to enhance the graphical features of the game. In some cases, Blender, a 3D content creation suite is used to create some graphical objects in 3D Max format that saves an object as a composite of many meshes along with relevant information like lighting, camera position and UV mapping. A 3D Max object can then be easily parsed and processed by a C/C++ program by making use of the 3dslib library.

In particular, some games have such an immense state space and high degree of uncertainty that traditional algorithms and methods struggle to play them effectively. Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) has brought significant improvements to the level of computer programs in games such as Go, and it has been used to play partial information games as well. However, there are certain games with particularly large trees and reduced information in which a naive MCTS approach is insufficient: in particular, this is the case of games with long matches, dynamic information, and complex victory conditions. In this paper we explore the application of MCTS to a wargame-like board game, Kriegspiel. We describe and study three MCTS-based methods, starting from a very simple implementation and moving to more refined versions for playing the game with little specific knowledge. We compare these MCTS-based programs to the strongest known minimax-based Kriegspiel program, obtaining significantly better experimental results with less domain-specific knowledge.",

From a computational standpoint, this means that weights for aesthetic features need not be, for example, determined by analyzing a particular data set of aesthetically-rated objects or through consultation with human experts. Instead, the metrics can be used as building blocks to formalize aesthetic principles or features in a logical and dynamic way that is arguably an improvement over existing methods.

From a computational standpoint, the importance of universal metrics in the aesthetics of chess and other domains is explored.",

Nevertheless, by applying the same methodology to the Monaco 2002-2007 data set a substantial difference between the blindfold and the rapid chess game was noticed.

      "908": "The game of chess has been a major testbed for research in artificial intelligence, since it requires focus on intelligent reasoning. Particularly, several challenges arise to machine learning systems when inducing a model describing legal moves of the chess, including the collection of the examples, the learning of a model correctly representing the official rules of the game, covering all the branches and restrictions of the correct moves, and the comprehensibility of such a model. Besides, the game of chess has inspired the creation of numerous variants, ranging from faster to more challenging or to regional versions of the game. The question arises if it is possible to take advantage of an initial classifier of chess as a starting point to obtain classifiers for the different variants. We approach this problem as an instance of theory revision from examples. The initial classifier of chess is inspired by a FOL theory approved by a chess expert and the examples are defined as sequences of moves within a game. Starting from a standard revision system, we argue that abduction and negation are also required to best address this problem. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.",

This work provides insights into the properties of adversarial search spaces that play a key role in the success or failure of UCT and similar samplingbased approaches. We show that certain \"early loss\" or \"shallow trap\" configurations, while unlikely in Go, occur surprisingly often in games like Chess (even in grandmaster games).

      "915": "Rapid chess provides an unparalleled laboratory to understand decision making in a natural environment. In a chess game, players choose consecutively around 40 moves in a finite time budget. The goodness of each choice can be determined quantitatively since current chess algorithms estimate precisely the value of a position. Web-based chess produces vast amounts of data, millions of decisions per day, incommensurable with traditional psychological experiments. We generated a database of response times (RTs) and position value in rapid chess games. We measured robust emergent statistical observables: (1) RT distributions are long-tailed and show qualitatively distinct forms at different stages of the game, (2) RT of successive moves are highly correlated both for intra-and inter-player moves. These findings have theoretical implications since they deny two basic assumptions of sequential decision making algorithms: RTs are not stationary and can not be generated by a state-function. Our results also have practical implications. First, we characterized the capacity of blunders and score fluctuations to predict a player strength, which is yet an open problem in chess softwares. Second, we show that the winning likelihood can be reliably estimated from a weighted combination of remaining times and position evaluation.",

The algorithm combines a Monte-Carlo update of the agent's belief state with a Monte-Carlo tree search from the current belief state. The new algorithm, POMCP, has two important properties. First, Monte-Carlo sampling is used to break the curse of dimensionality both during belief state updates and during planning. Second, only a black box simulator of the POMDP is required, rather than explicit probability distributions. These properties enable POMCP to plan effectively in significantly larger POMDPs than has previously been possible. We demonstrate its effectiveness in three large POMDPs. We scale up a well-known benchmark problem, rocksample, by several orders of magnitude. We also introduce two challenging new POMDPs: 10 \u00d7 10 battleship and partially observable PacMan, with approximately 10 18 and 10 56 states respectively. Our Monte-Carlo planning algorithm achieved a high level of performance with no prior knowledge, and was also able to exploit simple domain knowledge to achieve better results with less search.

To this end, we develop an extension of GDL that is both simple and elegant yet expressive enough to allow to formalise the rules of arbitrary (discrete and finite) n-player games with randomness and incomplete state knowledge.

Sub-7-man chess is essentially solved in that almost all its positions' values and Depths to Mate (DTM) are documented in publicly available endgame tables (EGTs). However, the assessment of the chess study community's criteria of uniqueness has not yet been systematically assisted by the perfect information of EGTs. This note proves that this can be done by defining appropriate changes to the game of chess and analysing the impact of those changes as evidenced by the new chess variant's EGTs. Specifically, the values of positions in a set SP are redefined to create variant Chess(SP). The approach is practical and challenges authors of EGT generators to generalise them to accommodate Chess(SP). It also addresses a number of similar questions arising in endgame theory, games and compositions.",

This approach was compared against a 'random' one. Comparisons were made using 'experiences' derived from three different databases, i.e. problems by human composers (HC), computer-generated compositions that used the HC experience (CG), and mating 'combinations' taken from tournament games between humans (TG). Each showed a reasonable and statistically significant increase in efficiency compared to the random one but not each other. Aesthetically, the HC and CG were better than the others. The results suggest that composing efficiency and quality can be improved using simple probability information derived from human compositions, and unexpectedly even from the computer-generated compositions that result. Additionally, these improvements come at a very low computational cost. They can be used to further aid and entertain human players and composers.",

The conventional dimensionality reduction techniques, however, focus on reproducing the underlying configuration space, rather than the dynamics itself. The constructed low-dimensional space does not provide complete and accurate description of the dynamics. Here I describe how to perform dimensionality reduction while preserving the essential properties of the dynamics. The approach is illustrated by analyzing the chess game -the archetype of complex dynamics. A variable that provides complete and accurate description of chess dynamics is constructed. Winning probability is predicted by describing the game as a random walk on the free energy landscape associated with the variable. The approach suggests a possible way of obtaining a simple yet accurate description of many important complex phenomena. The analysis of the chess game shows that the approach can quantitatively describe the dynamics of processes where human decision-making plays a central role, e.g., financial and social dynamics.",

By representing the domain as a Markov Game, we enable the robot to not only react to the human but also to construct an infinite horizon optimal policy of actions and responses. Experimentally, we apply our model to simulated robot sword defense. Our approach enables a simulated 7-DOF robot arm to block known attacks in any sequence. We generate optimized blocks and apply game theoretic tools to choose the best action for the defender in the presence of an intelligent adversary.",

Backward induction played a prominent role in Reinhard Selten's (1965) development of perfect equilibrium, and it has helped to shape the modern refinement literature.

A notable exception is Herbert Dreyfus who has developed a theory of expertise according to which expert action generally proceeds automatically and unreflectively. We address one of Dreyfus's primary examples of expertise: chess. At first glance, chess would seem an obvious counterexample to Dreyfus's view since, clearly, chess experts are engaged in deep strategic thought. However, Dreyfus's argument is subtle. He accepts that analysis and deliberation play a role in chess, yet he thinks that all such thought is predicated on intuitive, arational expert perception, and action. We argue that even the so-called \"intuitive\" aspect of chess is rational through and through.",

Intrinsic quality is estimated via evaluations given by computer chess programs run to high depth, ideally so that their playing strength is sufficiently far ahead of the best human players as to be a 'relatively omniscient' guide. Several formulas, each having intrinsic skill parameters s for sensitivity and c for consistency, are argued theoretically and tested by regression on large sets of tournament games played by humans of varying strength as measured by the internationally standard Elo rating system. This establishes a correspondence between Elo rating and the parameters. A smooth correspondence is shown between statistical results and the century points on the Elo scale, and ratings are shown to have stayed quite constant over time. That is, there has been little or no 'rating inflation'. The theory and empirical results are transferable to other rationalchoice settings in which the alternatives have well-defined utilities, but in which complexity and bounded information constrain the perception of the utility values.",

Evidence that ratings have remained stable since the inception of the Elo system in the 1970's is given in several forms: by showing that the population of strong players fits a simple logistic-curve model without inflation, by plotting players' average error against the FIDE category of tournaments over time, and by skill parameters from a model that employs computer analysis keeping a nearly constant relation to Elo rating across that time. The distribution of the model's Intrinsic Performance Ratings can hence be used to compare populations that have limited interaction, such as between players in a national chess federation and FIDE, and ascertain relative drift in their respective rating systems.",

      "958": "Back in 1950, Shannon introduced planning in board games like Chess as a selective approach, where the main idea is to select specific branches of the game tree that satisfy certain conditions. He contrasted this approach with brute force Minimax-like methods, based on an exhaustive search of the game tree, that aims to select the best path inside a given search horizon. Historically, the brute force approach won hands down against planning in complex games such as Chess, as the strongest Chess programs nowadays all exploit brute force algorithms. However, planning is still interesting and even necessary in some game-playing domains, for instance based on incomplete information, where there is no way to evaluate precisely or even build the game tree. In this paper we describe a technique that produced positive results in Kriegspiel, a variant of Chess played as an incomplete information game. Our main result is the definition of an algorithm for combining MonteCarlo search with planning; we tested the algorithm on a strong Kriegspiel program based on MonteCarlo search, and obtained a clear improvement.",

At first the organisms are evolved to mimic the behavior of human grandmasters, and then these organisms are further improved upon by means of coevolution.

Our results show that the evolved program outperforms a two-time World Computer Chess Champion, and is on a par with other leading computer chess programs.",
      "960": "Since the mid 1960s, researchers in computer science have famously referred to chess as the 'drosophila' of artificial intelligence (AI). What they seem to mean by this is that chess, like the common fruit fly, is an accessible, familiar, and relatively simple experimental technology that nonetheless can be used productively to produce valid knowledge about other, more complex systems. But for historians of science and technology, the analogy between chess and drosophila assumes a larger significance. As Robert Kohler has ably described, the decision to adopt drosophila as the organism of choice for genetics research had far-reaching implications for the development of 20th century biology. In a similar manner, the decision to focus on chess as the measure of both human and computer intelligence had important and unintended consequences for AI research. This paper explores the emergence of chess as an experimental technology, its significance in the developing research practices of the AI community, and the unique ways in which the decision to focus on chess shaped the program of AI research in the decade of the 1970s.

      "962": "The increasing strength of chess engines and their fine-tuned ability to evaluate positions provide the opportunity to use computer analysis for assessing the strength of players on a move-by-move basis, as a game is being played. As each player makes a move on the board, a sufficiently strong engine will be able to determine whether that move has contributed to improve or degrade the position. This change in position evaluation is defined as the gain per move. In this article, we assume that it is possible to characterise a player by a distribution of gain over several moves, preferably across several games. We present an approach to estimate the strength of players based on their distributions of gain. This estimated strength is expressed in terms of a perceived Elo rating, which may differ from a player's actual rating. However, the average of the perceived Elo ratings is equal to the average of the actual Elo ratings for a set of players. A critical factor in the approach is the need to determine the strength of the engine used for analysis. Once this is obtained, it is possible to carry out all sorts of comparisons between players, even players from different eras who never competed against each other. There are many potential applications but here we focus mainly on developing the approach, using a few recent tournaments as well as some historical events for illustrative purposes.",

Study 1 partially replicated such studies with improvements such as use of peak rating and a large, skilled sample. Number of internationally-rated games played was the strongest predictor of peak rating. Total study hours was a significant but weaker predictor. Study 2 controlled for sampling confounds by including only very well-practiced players who had played at least 350 internationally-rated games. Total study hours did not predict rating at 350 games. Study 3 found that the subjective phenomenon of reaching a performance ceiling and undertaking specific practice to get beyond it does occur but does not distinguish between stronger and weaker players. Study 4 found that many players play relatively few internationally-rated games mostly because of other commitments, such as work and education. Extensive study may go along with great interest in and persistence at chess but apparently lacks a major causative role in chess performance level.",
      "968": "Composition conventions are guidelines or 'good practice' rules used by human composers in composing chess problems. They are especially important in composition tournaments or 'tourneys' (to differentiate from chess-playing tournaments). Examples of conventions include, not having any 'check' in the first move of the solution and not 'dressing up' the board with unnecessary pieces. Conventions are often associated or even directly conflated with the overall aesthetics or beauty of a composition. Using an existing experimentally-validated computational aesthetics model for three-move mate problems, we analyzed 888 computergenerated compositions adhering to at least 2 conventions and 632 adhering to at least 3 conventions to test if simply conforming to more conventions had a positive effect on their aesthetics, as is generally believed by human composers. We found slight but statistically significant evidence that it does. We also analyzed human judge scores of 145 three-move mate problems composed by humans -as human judges seldom ignore the role of composition conventions in their assessments -to see if they had any positive correlation with the computational aesthetic scores of those problems. We found that they did not. These seemingly conflicting findings suggest two main things. First, an increase in the number of 'appropriate' composition conventions (perhaps not just any of them) adhered to in a composition has a positive effect on its perceived aesthetics. Second, given the lack of any positive correlation between the human judge scores and the computational aesthetic scores, human judges either do not look at the 'appropriate' conventions related to aesthetics or emphasize others that have less to do with beauty per se, even though they may mistakenly consider their judgements 'beautiful' in the traditional, non-esoteric sense. Human judges may also be relying significantly on personal tastes which have little 'objective' aesthetic merit. Their selections are therefore no less valid, but perhaps they have less to do with beauty than previously assumed.",

These programs are often referred to as \"bots,\" and can even play the game without any user interaction. In this paper, we describe a methodology aimed at preventing bots from participating in online chess games. The proposed approach is based on the integration of a CAPTCHA protocol into a game scenario, and the subsequent inability of bots to accurately track the game states. This is achieved by rotating the images of the individual chess pieces and adjusting their resolution in an attempt to render them unreadable by a bot. Feedback from users during testing shows that there is minimal impact on their ability to play the game. Players rated the difficulty of reading the pieces on a scale of one to ten, with an average rank of 6.5. However, the average number of moves to adjust to the distorted pieces was only 3.75. This tells us that, although it is difficult to read the pieces at first, it is easy to adjust quickly to the new image.",

This complexity and the availability of large number of recorded matches make chess an ideal model systems for the study of population-level learning of a complex system. We systematically investigate the move-bymove dynamics of the white player's advantage from over seventy thousand high level chess matches spanning over 150 years. We find that the average advantage of the white player is positive and that it has been increasing over time. Currently, the average advantage of the white player is \u223c0.17 pawns but it is exponentially approaching a value of 0.23 pawns with a characteristic time scale of 67 years. We also study the diffusion of the move dependence of the white player's advantage and find that it is non-Gaussian, has long-ranged anti-correlations and that after an initial period with no diffusion it becomes super-diffusive. We find that the duration of the non-diffusive period, corresponding to the opening stage of a match, is increasing in length and exponentially approaching a value of 15.6 moves with a characteristic time scale of 130 years. We interpret these two trends as a resulting from learning of the features of the game. Additionally, we find that the exponent \u03b1 characterizing the super-diffusive regime is increasing toward a value of 1.9, close to the ballistic regime. We suggest that this trend is due to the increased broadening of the range of abilities of chess players participating in major tournaments.",

Trap A B can be regarded as an extension of the traditional alpha-beta search algorithm which ties to predict when the opponent might make a mistake and select such moves that can most likely lead the an opponent into the trap by comparing the various scores returned through iterative deepening technology. In Trap A B , we define two basic components: 1) defining a trap by considering the nature of alpha-beta search algorithm and referring the evaluation value returned by iterative deepening; and 2) evaluating a trap by calculating the probability that the opponent fall into the trap and the advantage followed when the opponent fall into it. In our experiment, we test the performance of Trap A B in comparison with three game-tree search algorithms, i.e., min-max, trappy minimax, and alpha-beta, by playing with four testing opponents (their depthes are 7, 8, 9, and 10 respectively), which are obtained form a typical Chinese chess computer game programme-Xqwizard (",
      "995": "In this paper we examine the value of the information contained in networks constructed from positions in chess games with respect to game analysis and predictive power. The interrelations of pieces in a chess game represent complex and evolving networks that describe both tactical and strategic elements of the game. Even when a chess game is represented as a network of interrelations among the pieces, abstracting away all of the specifics and details of the game, such as the value of pieces or the notion of the board \"center,\" the network still contains valuable information about the game played, when the critical moments are, and what the likely outcome will be. By representing a game as a series of networks, each modeling a different aspect of the connections among the pieces and the board, even richer information is available. By additionally considering the evolution of the graphs as a time series through the course of the game, still more information can be gathered. With only minimal encoding of game rules and logic, this series of evolving graphs is able to capture with surprising fidelity the evaluation of the game. In this paper we examine the information that can be extracted from the evolution of these networks and show that their predictive power surpasses that of an evaluation function that directly employs the rules and strategies of chess.",
      "997": "Prominent expertise researchers have repeatedly emphasized that individual differences in general cognitive abilities, in particular intelligence, do not play any role for the attained level of expertise in a given domain. This strong claim is opposed with the current body of evidence on the relevance of intelligence for expert performance in the prototypical expertise domain of chess. Although the findings are not unequivocal, presumably due to methodological aspects, several studies employing psychometric tests of intelligence have revealed that expert chess players display significantly higher intelligence than controls and that their playing strength is related to their intelligence level. In addition, by using the extended expert-novice paradigm (comparing experts with novices of different intelligence levels) it has been found that both, expertise and intelligence impact on the performance in expertise-related tasks. These studies suggest that expert chess play does not stand in isolation from intelligence and could stimulate interdisciplinary research on the role of general cognitive abilities in expertise development.",

The algorithm stores and then reuses chains or sequences of moves, built up from previous searches. These move sequences have a built-in forward-pruning mechanism that can radically reduce the search space. A typical search process might retrieve a move from a Transposition Table , \nwhere the decision of what move to retrieve would be based on the position itself. This algorithm stores move sequences based on what previous sequences were better, or caused cutoffs. This is therefore position independent and so it could also be useful in games with imperfect information or uncertainty, where the whole situation is not known at any one time. Over a small set of tests, the algorithm was shown to clearly out-perform Transposition Tables, both in terms of search reduction and game-play results.",

      "1003": "Complexity develops via the incorporation of innovative properties. Chess is one of the most complex strategy games, where expert contenders exercise decision making by imitating old games or introducing innovations. In this work, we study innovation in chess by analyzing how different move sequences are played at the population level. It is found that the probability of exploring a new or innovative move decreases as a power law with the frequency of the preceding move sequence. Chess players also exploit already known move sequences according to their frequencies, following a preferential growth mechanism. Furthermore, innovation in chess exhibits Heaps' law suggesting similarities with the process of vocabulary growth. We propose a robust generative mechanism based on nested Yule-Simon preferential growth processes that reproduces the empirical observations. These results, supporting the self-similar nature of innovations in chess are important in the context of decision making in a competitive scenario, and extend the scope of relevant findings recently discovered regarding the emergence of Zipf 's law in chess.",

In 1972, Fischer became an American Cold War hero as he wrestled the World Chess Championship from a half century of Soviet domination. His rapid rise to world fame was followed by infamy as Fischer abandoned competitive chess, grew increasingly Anti -Semitic and Anti -American, became a fugitive from U.S. justice, and died in relative isolation in Reykjavik, Iceland. Fischer remains one of the more enigmatic personalities of the 20th century and many questions remain regarding his psychological health.

We used two mapping rules to build discrete time series and analyzed them using two methods for detecting long-range correlations; rescaled range analysis and detrended fluctuation analysis. We found that long-range memory is related to the level of the players. When the database is filtered according to player levels we found differences in the persistence of the different subsets. For high level players, correlations are stronger at long time scales; whereas in intermediate and low level players they reach the maximum value at shorter time scales. This can be interpreted as a signature of the different strategies used by players with different levels of expertise. These results are robust against the assignation rules and the method employed in the analysis of the time series.",
      "1009": "In a wide range of problem-solving settings, the presence of a familiar solution can block the discovery of better solutions (i.e., the Einstellung effect). To investigate this effect, we monitored the eye movements of expert and novice chess players while they solved chess problems that contained a familiar move (i.e., the Einstellung move), as well as an optimal move that was located in a different region of the board. When the Einstellung move was an advantageous (but suboptimal) move, both the expert and novice chess players who chose the Einstellung move continued to look at this move throughout the trial, whereas the subset of expert players who chose the optimal move were able to gradually disengage their attention from the Einstellung move. However, when the Einstellung move was a blunder, all of the experts and the majority of the novices were able to avoid selecting the Einstellung move, and both the experts and novices gradually disengaged their attention from the Einstellung move. These findings shed light on the boundary conditions of the Einstellung effect, and provide convergent evidence for Bilalic \u00b4, McLeod, & Gobet (2008)'s conclusion that the Einstellung effect operates by biasing attention towards problem features that are associated with the familiar solution rather than the optimal solution.",

Most of the previous work in this area has normally adopted co-evolution (i.e., tournaments among virtual players) to decide which players will pass to the following generation, depending on the outcome of each game. In contrast, our proposed method uses evolution to decide which virtual players will pass to the next generation based on the number of positions solved from a number of chess grandmaster games. Using a search depth of 1-ply, our method can solve 40.78% of the positions evaluated from chess grandmaster games (this value is higher than the one reported in the previous related work). Additionally, our method is capable of solving 53.08% of the positions using a historical mechanism that keeps a record of the \"good\" virtual players found during the evolutionary process. Our proposal has also been able to increase the competition level of our search engine, when playing against the program Chessmaster (grandmaster edition). Our chess engine reached a rating of 2404 points for the best virtual player with supervised learning, and a rating of 2442 points for the best virtual player with unsupervised learning. Finally, it is also worth mentioning that our results indicate that the piece material values obtained by our approach are similar to the values known from chess theory.",

One of the reasons is that most of the studies investigated only one factor (e.g., intelligence), neglecting other factors relevant for the acquisition of chess skill (e.g., amount of practice, years of experience). The present study investigated the chess skill of 57 young chess players using measures of intelligence (WISC III), practice, and experience. Although practice had the most influence on chess skill, intelligence explained some variance even after the inclusion of practice. When an elite subsample of 23 children was tested, it turned out that intelligence was not a significant factor in chess skill, and that, if anything, it tended to correlate negatively with chess skill. This unexpected result is explained by a negative correlation between intelligence and practice in the elite subsample. The study demonstrates the dangers of focusing on a single factor in complex real-world situations where a number of closely interconnected factors operate.",

The present study tested the power law's generality to development over many years of a very complex cognitive skill, chess playing, with 387 skilled participants, most of whom were grandmasters. A power or logarithmic function best fit grouped data but individuals showed much variability. An exponential function usually was the worst fit to individual data. Groups differing in chess talent were compared and a power function best fit the group curve for the more talented players while a quadratic function best fit that for the less talented.

      "1036": "Theories of expertise based on the acquisition of chunk and templates suggest a differential geometric organization of perception between experts and novices. It is implied that expert representation is less anchored by spatial (Euclidean) proximity and may instead be dictated by the intrinsic relation in the structure and grammar of the specific domain of expertise. Here we set out to examine this hypothesis. We used the domain of chess which has been widely used as a tool to study human expertise. We reasoned that the movement of an opponent piece to a specific square constitutes an external cue and the reaction of the player to this \"perturbation\" should reveal his internal representation of proximity. We hypothesized that novice players will tend to respond by moving a piece in closer squares than experts. Similarly, but now in terms of object representations, we hypothesized weak players will more likely focus on a specific piece and hence produce sequence of actions repeating movements of the same piece. We capitalized on a large corpus of data obtained from internet chess servers. Results showed that, relative to experts, weaker players tend to (1) produce consecutive moves in proximal board locations, (2) move more often the same piece and (3) reduce the number of remaining pieces more rapidly, most likely to decrease cognitive load and mental effort. These three principles might reflect the effect of expertise on human actions in complex setups.",

There was also an effect of focal player, as Carlsen was given more responsibility both for losses and wins than Anand, by the present (Norwegian) pro-Carlsen samples.

To manipulate relevancy, we constructed two different versions of each chess problem in the experiment, and we counterbalanced these versions across participants. These two versions of each problem were identical except that a single piece was changed from a bishop to a knight. This subtle change reversed the relevancy map of the board, such that regions that were relevant in one version of the board were now irrelevant (and vice versa). Using this paradigm, we demonstrated that both the experts and novices spent more time fixating the relevant relative to the irrelevant regions of the board. However, the experts were faster at detecting relevant information than the novices, as shown by the finding that experts (but not novices) were able to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information during the early part of the trial. These findings further demonstrate the domain-related perceptual processing advantage of chess experts, using an experimental paradigm that allowed us to manipulate relevancy under tightly controlled conditions.",

      "1059": "The Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) is of utmost importance for comparing evolutionary algorithms as the performance of one algorithm over another can be scientifically proven. However, NHST is often misused, improperly applied and misinterpreted. In order to avoid the pitfalls of NHST usage this paper proposes a new method, a Chess Rating System for Evolutionary Algorithms (CRS4EAs) for the comparison and ranking of evolutionary algorithms. A computational experiment in CRS4EAs is conducted in the form of a tournament where the evolutionary algorithms are treated as chess players and a comparison between the solutions of two algorithms on the objective function is treated as one game outcome. The rating system used in CRS4EAs was inspired by the Glicko-2 rating system, based on the Bradley-Terry model for dynamic pairwise comparisons, where each algorithm is represented by rating, rating deviation, a rating/confidence interval, and rating volatility. The CRS4EAs was empirically compared to NHST within a computational experiment conducted on 16 evolutionary algorithms and a benchmark suite of 20 numerical minimisation problems. The analysis of the results shows that the CRS4EAs is comparable with NHST but may also have many additional benefits. The computations in CRS4EAs are less complicated and sensitive than those in statistical significance tests, the method is less sensitive to outliers, reliable ratings can be obtained over a small number of runs, and the conservativity/liberality of CRS4EAs is easier to control.",

      "1063": "Previous studies have generally found no relation between IQ and chess skill in chess experts. This lack of a relation could be due to the influence of practice being more important than IQ in chess expertise. An alternative explanation is that IQ is relatively high and might therefore be restricted in range in chess experts. The current study investigated the contribution of practice, IQ and motivation to chess performance prospectively in a group of young, novice chess players in which IQ restriction of range did not play a role. Children who entered their first chess course were asked to complete weekly diaries indicating the amount of practice and their enjoyment of the course. IQ and motivation were measured using standardized tests. Using path analysis, we found that IQ and practice independently predicted chess performance on a chess test at the end of the course. Motivation influenced performance indirectly, by moderating the amount of practice that was undertaken. The results indicate that, at the early stages of expertise development, IQ and motivation influence chess performance.",

We evaluated whether sex differences were due to differential participation rates of males and females, and whether age and practice were able to predict differences in chess ability. There were meaningful sex differences in Elo ratings unrelated to different participation rates. Age and practice predicted sex differences in Elo chess ratings for females, but not for males. The findings paralleled those concerning sex differences in cognitive ability research, and supported that biosocial factors (i.e., age and practice) rather than divergences in participation rates of males and females in the domain influenced the extreme sex differences in Elo ratings.",

Being multipolar, this world will inevitably lead to frictions where civilizations and states will have to decide whether to risk conflict. Very often these decisions are informed if not taken by experts. To estimate risk-taking across civilizations, we examined strategies used in 667,617 chess games played over ten years by chess experts from 12 different civilizations. We show that some civilizations are more inclined to settle for peace. Similarly, we show that once engaged in the battle, the level of risk taking varies significantly across civilizations, the boldest civilization using the riskiest strategy about 35% more than the most conservative civilization. We discuss which psychological factors might underpin these civilizational differences.",

      "1073": "We introduce a new artificial intelligence (AI) approach or technique termed, the 'Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate' (DSNS). This technique uses selected attributes from objects in various domains (e.g. chess problems, classical music, renowned artworks) and recombines them in such a way as to generate new attributes that can then, in principle, be used to create novel objects of creative value to humans relating to any one of the source domains. This allows some of the burden of creative content generation to be passed from humans to machines. The approach was tested primarily in the domain of chess problem composition. We used the DSNS technique to automatically compose numerous sets of chess problems based on attributes extracted and recombined from chess problems and tournament games by humans, renowned paintings, computer-evolved abstract art, photographs of people, and classical music tracks. The quality of these generated chess problems was then assessed automatically using an existing and experimentally-validated computational chess aesthetics model. They were also assessed by human experts in the domain. The results suggest that attributes collected and recombined from chess and other domains using the DSNS approach can indeed be used to automatically generate chess problems of reasonably high aesthetic quality. In particular, a low quality chess source (i.e. tournament game sequences between weak players) used in combination with actual photographs of people was able to produce three-move chess problems of comparable quality or better to those generated using a high quality chess source (i.e. published compositions by human experts), and more efficiently as well. Why information from a foreign domain can be integrated and functional in this way remains an open question for now. The DSNS approach is, in principle, scalable and applicable to any domain in which objects have attributes that can be represented using real numbers.",

Although many studies proved the link between mastery in chess and high degree of intelligence, just few studies proved that chess practice can enhance cognitive abilities. Starting from these considerations, the main purpose of the present research was to investigate the potential benefits of in-presence chess lessons and on-line training on mathematical problem-solving ability in young pupils (8 to 11 years old). Five hundred sixty students were divided into two groups, experimental (which had chess course and on-line training) and control (which had normal school activities), and tested on their mathematical and chess abilities. Results show a strong correlation between chess and math scores, and a higher improvement in math in the experimental group compared with the control group. These results foster the hypothesis that even a short-time practice of chess in children can be a useful tool to enhance their mathematical abilities.",

Methods: We used two nonlinear methods: Higuchi Fractal Dimension that is a good and fast tool for analyzing signal complexity and modification of Empirical Mode Decomposition, called Sliding Window Empirical Mode Decomposition, that breaks down a signal into its monocomponents. Obtained results are compared with the resting state i.e. EEG during relax witch closed eyes. Results: The analysis shows higher values of Higuchi Fractal Dimension during the thinking over chess moves than in the players' rest state.

Based on the typical number of moves required to transpose a given configuration of chess pieces into another, we conclude that the state space consists of several pockets between which transitions are rare. Skilled players explore an even smaller subset of positions that populate some of these pockets only very sparsely. These results suggest that the usual measures to estimate both, the size of the state space and the size of the tree of legal moves, are not unique indicators of the complexity of the game, but that topological considerations are equally important.",
      "1095": "There is a persistent higher performance of men over women in chess that has been attributed to the disproportioned participation rates of men and women in this domain, but also to biological and cultural factors. This study addresses the disparity between men and women in performance at the expert chess level. Actual sex differences in chess performance were contrasted with differences estimated from the divergent participation rates of men and women chess players from twenty-four countries in the Eurasian region. There was a male advantage in chess performance throughout all countries. Sex differences in chess performance emerged for all the studied countries, with remarkable and highly variable unexplained gaps that were unrelated to the men versus women ratios. The cross-country variability about sex differences in chess performance indicates differences in geographical and cultural factors that might elicit differential participation rates, starting age, and perseverance in the domain for men and women. These differences are also likely to underlie the remarkable disparity in expert chess performance of men and women than only differential participation rates.",

Thus, our example strengthens significantly the one obtained in 2014 by Gurvich and Oudalov, which has four players, five terminals, and 2\u00d74\u00d76\u00d78 normal form.

Chess skill correlated positively and significantly with fluid reasoning (Gf) (r = 0.24), comprehension-knowledge (Gc) (r = 0.22), short-term memory (Gsm) (r = 0.25), and processing speed (Gs) (r = 0.24); the meta-analytic average of the correlations was (r = 0.24). Moreover, the correlation between Gf and chess skill was moderated by age (r = 0.32 for youth samples vs. r = 0.11 for adult samples), and skill level (r = 0.32 for unranked samples vs. r = 0.14 for ranked samples). Interestingly, chess skill correlated more strongly with numerical ability (r = 0.35) than with verbal ability (r = 0.19) or visuospatial ability (r = 0.13). The results suggest that cognitive ability contributes meaningfully to individual differences in chess skill, particularly in young chess players and/or at lower levels of skill.",

We apply this to Phantom Go, which, as all phantom games, is hard for opening book learning.

Without any a priori knowledge, in particular without any knowledge regarding the rules of chess, a deep neural network is trained using a combination of unsupervised pretraining and supervised training. The unsupervised training extracts high level features from a given position, and the supervised training learns to compare two chess positions and select the more favorable one. The training relies entirely on datasets of several million chess games, and no further domain specific knowledge is incorporated. The experiments show that the resulting neural network (referred to as DeepChess) is on a par with state-of-the-art chess playing programs, which have been developed through many years of manual feature selection and tuning. DeepChess is the first end-to-end machine learning-based method that results in a grandmaster-level chess playing performance.",

In previous work we demonstrated how combining photographs of people and sequences taken from chess games between weak players can be used to generate chess problems or puzzles of higher aesthetic quality, on average, compared to alternative approaches. In this work we show experimentally that using larger images as opposed to smaller ones improves the output quality even further. The same is also true for using clearer or less corrupted images. The reasons why these things influence the DSNS process is presently not well-understood and debatable but the findings are nevertheless immediately applicable for obtaining better results.",
      "1105": "In Progressive chess, rather than just making one move per turn, players play progressively longer series of moves. Combinatorial complexity generated by many sequential moves represents a difficult challenge for classic search algorithms. In this article, we present the design of a state-of-the-art program for Progressive chess. The program follows the generally recommended strategy for this game, which consists of three phases: looking for possibilities to checkmate the opponent, playing sequences of generally good moves when checkmate is not available, and preventing checkmates from the opponent. For efficient and effective checkmate search we considered two versions of the A* algorithm, and developed five different heuristics for guiding the search. For finding promising sequences of moves we developed another set of heuristics, and combined the A* algorithm with minimax search, in order to fight the combinatorial complexity. We constructed an opening book, and designed specialized heuristics for playing Progressive chess endgames. An application with a graphical user interface was implemented in order to enable human players to play Progressive chess against the computer, and to use the computer to analyze their games. The program performed excellently in experiments with checkmate search, and won both mini-matches against a human chess master. We also present the findings of self-play experiments between different versions of the program.",

The advantage of the Elo system is the explicit consideration of the factor time or the history of a journal's performance. Most other rankings that are commonly applied neglect this fact. The Elo ranking approach can easily be applied to any metric, published on a regular basis, to rank journals. We illustrate the approach using the SNIP indicator based on citation data from Scopus. Our balanced panel consists of 7,748 journals from many scientific fields for the period from 1999 to 2015. We show that the Elo approach produces a similar but not identical ranking compared to other rankings based on the SNIP. Especially the rank order for rather 'middle-class' journals can tremendously change.",

Nowadays, many children are addicted on the computer games, and tend to neglect the traditional games like chess game. The electronic chess set is designed in order to attract the interest of the children on the chess game. Besides that, the game provides some basic rules for beginner. These rules are the placement of the chess pieces for the opening of the chess game and the rule of chess pieces' movement during the chess game. In order to increase the number of input or output pins of the Arduino microcontroller, the cascade encoder, multiplexer and shift register are designed. The placement and the type of the chess piece is detected using infrared light-emitting diode and photodiode with the aid of cascade encoder and multiplexer, whereas the valid destinations of the current chess piece are displayed using lightemitting diode with the aid of cascade shift register. The real situation of the chess game is also displayed on the computer screen using graphical user interface (GUI). The project achieved its objectives by demonstrating the capability to detect the position and type of chess piece, and displaying the real situation of the chess game on the computer screen via GUI.",
      "1110": "War chess gaming has so far received insufficient attention but is a significant component of turn-based strategy games (TBS) and is studied in this paper. First, a common game model is proposed through various existing war chess types. Based on the model, we propose a theory frame involving combinational optimization on the one hand and game tree search on the other hand. We also discuss a key problem, namely, that the number of the branching factors of each turn in the game tree is huge. Then, we propose two algorithms for searching in one turn to solve the problem: (1) enumeration by order; (2) enumeration by recursion. The main difference between these two is the permutation method used: the former uses the dictionary sequence method, while the latter uses the recursive permutation method. Finally, we prove that both of these algorithms are optimal, and we analyze the difference between their efficiencies. An important factor is the total time taken for the unit to expand until it achieves its reachable position. The factor, which is the total number of expansions that each unit makes in its reachable position, is set. The conclusion proposed is in terms of this factor: Enumeration by recursion is better than enumeration by order in all situations.",
      "1111": "Transfer learning in reinforcement learning has been an active area of research over the past decade. In transfer learning, training on a source task is leveraged to speed up or otherwise improve learning on a target task. This paper presents the more ambitious problem of curriculum learning in reinforcement learning, in which the goal is to design a sequence of source tasks for an agent to train on, such that final performance or learning speed is improved. We take the position that each stage of such a curriculum should be tailored to the current ability of the agent in order to promote learning new behaviors. Thus, as a first step towards creating a curriculum, the trainer must be able to create novel, agent-specific source tasks. We explore how such a space of useful tasks can be created using a parameterized model of the domain and observed trajectories on the target task. We experimentally show that these methods can be used to form components of a curriculum and that such a curriculum can be used successfully for transfer learning in 2 challenging multiagent reinforcement learning domains.",

This approach reduced the intractable class space in chess by a square root.",
      "1115": "Since the advent of computers, many tasks which required humans to spend a lot of time and energy have been trivialized by the computers' ability to perform repetitive tasks extremely quickly. However there are still many areas in which humans excel in comparison with the machines. One such area is chess. Even with great advances in the speed and computational power of modern machines, Grandmasters often beat the best chess programs in the world with relative ease 1 . This may be due to the fact that a game of chess cannot be won by pure calculation. There is more to the goodness of a chess position than some numerical value which apparently can be seen only by the human brain. Here an effort has been made to improve current chess engines by letting themselves evolve over a period of time. Firstly, the problem of learning is reduced into an optimization problem by defining Position Evaluation in terms of Positional Value Tables (PVTs). Next, the PVTs are optimized using Multi-Niche Crowding which successfully identifies the optima in a multimodal function, thereby arriving at distinctly different solutions which are close to the global optimum.",

At the same time, chess involves skills that are highly correlated with dyslexia, such as visuospatial and calculation abilities. In this paper, we created a online chess game designed for people with dyslexia and seek to understand whether people with dyslexia learn and play chess online in ways that differ from other students and whether such differences may be leveraged to improve classroom performance. To test how people with dyslexia learn to play chess we carried out a within-subject experiment with 62 participants, 31 of them with diagnosed dyslexia. Participants used an instrumented web-based chess learning platform that we developed to (i) complete lessons on how to play chess and about chess theory, (ii) work through exercises designed to test and reaffirm their skills, and (iii) play chess against a computer opponent. We could not find significant differences on four dependent measures out of the twelve measures we collected. Therefore, dyslexia might have an impact on how people learn and play chess using a computer, suggesting that chess may be useful as a fun way to help people with dyslexia improve their abilities.",

      "1120": "The failure of economic central planning in the Soviet Union is interpreted as evidence of the impossibility of efficient central planning. But the deficiencies of the Soviet economy might have resulted from other factors, such as Soviet history, culture, leadership, and/or unique circumstances, such as the Cold War. If so, the failure of the Soviet Union would not necessarily constitute evidence against the impossibility of central planning under different conditions. Yet, in some areas such as chess and the Olympics, central planning in the Soviet Union was remarkably successful. We examine the implications of Soviet successes in Olympics and chess to reassess the epistemic and motivational arguments against central planning. We contend that three factors help explain Soviet sports successes: first, the objectivity of success in sports or chess in contrast with the subjectivity of economic success; second, the importance of fame and renown as motives for Olympic class athletes and chess grand masters; and third, the poor economic performance of the Soviet Union, which helped ensure incentive compatibility. The Soviet Union's success in achieving goals that did not require complex economic information or a fundamental realignment of incentives, but not in centrally planning the economy, reinforce the epistemic and motivational arguments against economic central planning.",

      "1126": "The Spearman's law of diminishing returns (SLODR) contends that a general factor of cognitive ability (g) is more efficient to account for individual differences in intellectual performance in low ability than in high ability groups. Several works support the SLODR, albeit other studies have questioned it with one of the main criticisms being the splitting up between low and high ability groups. This study evaluates the SLODR with data from the chess domain with the Amsterdam chess test (ACT). Chess ability relates closely with several cognitive abilities that load in g, whereas the Elo chess rating is a robust quantitative indicator of chess skill that is suitable to determine differentiated ability groups. A structural equation model with five subtests from the ACT for low and high Elo chess rating groups indicated a better overall model fit for the low ability group. Factor invariance analyses about the variance explained by g, residual variances, and g-loadings, indicated that the highest variation between low and high chess ability groups arose in the model constraining equal g-loadings between both groups. These findings supported the SLODR in chess.",

Next, we recast a number of ranking theories within Landau's framework, thereby showing similarities and the ease with which each may be deduced from the previous one. The fields covered are sports, social choice, sociology, bibliometrics, internet ranking, learning, network economics and management. We show the closeness of the Landau with the Leontief input-output model and how the former is the limit of the latter. Lastly, we give self-contained proofs of the Perron and Frobenius theorems whose use in the social sciences Landau pioneered.",

Embedded in these big data is valuable information or knowledge. This calls for machine learning techniques for supporting advanced knowledge discovery from these big heterogeneous data. A rich source of big data is game data, which include data collected from sports games, card games, online video games, and board games like chess games. The deep interaction and simplicity of representation afforded by the game of chess have worked together to produce one of the most studied games in the world. It is a great intellectual challenge, and not only for humans. While chess engines can sometimes play chess better than grandmasters and can be used to assist the study of games or individual positions, the engines may not help a chess student choose which games to study. In this paper, we present a machine learning system with unsupervised learning and supervised learning components to analyze big chess data. Evaluation results show that not only can machine learning help find interesting games, but also that chess can be a great testing ground for machine learning and data mining techniques for big data analytics.",

By using the information from endgame database, the constructed approximated evaluation function can be use to valid and fine-tune the original evaluation function of any program. Experiment result shows that the approximation evaluation function is both highly correlated to the original evaluation and the theoretical value in the endgame database, therefore it can be used to adjust the original evaluation function with the data extracted from endgame database.",

For instance the strategies for the strongest poker agents are represented as massive binary files. In many situations, we would like to compute strategies that can actually be implemented by humans, who may have computational limitations and may only be able to remember a small number of features or components of the strategies that have been computed. For example, a human poker player or military leader may not have access to large precomputed tables when making real-time strategic decisions. We study poker games where private information distributions can be arbitrary (i.e., players are dealt cards from different distributions, which depicts the phenomenon in large real poker games where at some points in the hand players have different distribution of hand strength by applying Bayes' rule given the history of play in the hand thus far). We create a large training set of game instances and solutions, by randomly selecting the information probabilities, and present algorithms that learn from the training instances to perform well in games with unseen distributions. We are able to conclude several new fundamental rules about poker strategy that can be easily implemented by humans.",

In 1973, as one of three strategies he proposed for advancing Cognitive Science, Allen Newell exhorted us to \"accept a single complex task and do all of it.\" More specifically, he told us that rather than taking an \"experimental psychology as usual approach,\" we should \"focus on a series of experimental and theoretical studies around a single complex task\" so as to demonstrate that our theories of human cognition were powerful enough to explain \"a genuine slab of human behavior\" with the studies fitting into a detailed theoretical picture. Action games represent the type of experimental paradigm that Newell was advocating and the current state of programming expertise and laboratory equipment, along with the emergence of Big Data and naturally occurring datasets, provide the technologies and data needed to realize his vision. Action games enable us to escape from our field's regrettable focus on novice performance to develop theories that account for the full range of expertise through a twin focus on expertise sampling (across individuals) and longitudinal studies (within individuals) of simple and complex tasks.",

He used the example of the game of chess -where one would think complexity mattered positively -to illustrate this point. In this article, we explain how the same idea was tested but using a modern computational chess aesthetics model. We found, once again, and to a statistically significant degree, that the complexity of a chess puzzle or problem does not, on average, improve its aesthetic appeal. This suggests that making things more complicated than need be, simply to make the solution more difficult to find, especially in chess, should be avoided if improving aesthetics is the goal. This finding may be relevant to other artistic endeavours beyond chess as well.",

The proposed solution allows to run chess studies in shorter time and to analyse the differences between chess experts and novices with respect to visual attention and strategies in more detail.

      "1152": "Chess involves the capacity to reason iteratively about potential intentional choices of an opponent and therefore involves high levels of explicit theory of mind [ToM] (i.e. ability to infer mental states of others) alongside clear, strategic rule-based decision-making. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used on 12 healthy male novice chess players to identify cortical regions associated with chess, ToM and empathizing. The blood-oxygenationlevel-dependent (BOLD) response for chess and empathizing tasks was extracted from each ToM region. Results showed neural overlap between ToM, chess and empathizing tasks in right-hemisphere temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) [BA40], left-hemisphere superior temporal gyrus [BA22] and posterior cingulate gyrus [BA23/31]. TPJ is suggested to underlie the capacity to reason iteratively about another's internal state in a range of tasks. Areas activated by ToM and empathy included right-hemisphere orbitofrontal cortex and bilateral middle temporal gyrus: areas that become active when there is need to inhibit one's own experience when considering the internal state of another and for visual evaluation of action rationality. Results support previous findings, that ToM recruits a neural network with each region sub-serving a supporting role depending on the nature of the task itself. In contrast, a network of cortical regions primarily located within right-and left-hemisphere medial-frontal and parietal cortex, outside the internal representational network, was selectively recruited during the chess task. We hypothesize that in our cohort of novice chess players the strategy was to employ an iterative thinking pattern which in part involved mentalizing processes and recruited core ToM-related regions.",

If an approach needs more computational power, the design of the system allows it to scale. The system was designed using a loosely coupled architecture approach and the master-slave pattern. It works under Unix or MacOS operating systems. In order to split chess engine processing between every CPU in the system the Akka technology with the Scala language was used while the other part was written in Java. We tested many free chess engines connected to the system by the UCI protocol supported by the proposed system. CloudAMQP is an implementation of Advanced Message Queue Protocol and was used as a message-oriented middleware. This layer was created to split games between every available processing node connected to the system. This element also contributes to greater fault tolerance.

      "1154": "Substantial research in the psychology of expertise has shown that experts in several fields (e.g., science, mathematics) perform better than non-experts on standardized tests of intelligence. This evidence suggests that intelligence plays an important role in the acquisition of expertise. However, a counter argument is that the difference between experts and non-experts is not due to individuals' traits but to academic selection processes. For instance, in science, high scores on standardized tests (e.g., SAT and then GRE) are needed to be admitted to a university program for training. Thus, the \"academic selection process\" hypothesis is that expert vs. non-expert differences in cognitive ability reflect ability-related differences in access to training opportunities. To test this hypothesis, we focused on a domain in which there are no selection processes based on test scores: chess. This meta-analysis revealed that chess players outperformed non-chess players in intelligence-related skills (d = 0.49). Therefore, this outcome does not corroborate the academic selection process argument, and consequently, supports the idea that access to training alone cannot explain expert performance.",

Methods/Statistical Analysis: For dealing with probabilistic Krieg spiel, we took as a basis the proposal of Ciancarini, DallaLibera & Maran. They consider four Krieg spiel patterns which we modified to fulfill the probabilistic requirements of the tackled endgames. A strategy was also proposed for when none of these patterns is fulfilled. We developed an automaton which implements the proposed probabilistic patterns. Findings: Our results showed the feasibility of our proposal, where White won or drew as expected. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal that considers probabilistic Krieg spiel. Our automaton shows that when working with probabilities in Krieg spiel, it is not always convenient to play considering the higher probability. Our proposal develops a strategy that can help competitors to make better decisions when they have incomplete information about a specific situation, e.g., to choose between two alternatives, each with its respective probability. Application/Improvements: We believe that our proposal may be useful in areas where uncertainty occurs. It can help analysts, particularly in the economics and artificial intelligence, to make decisions when uncertainty occurs.",

A cross-domain latent curve model (LCM) was used to examine individual differences in age and in the simultaneous trajectory in chess tournament activity and chess performance. The main findings indicated individual differences in the change in tournament activity and performance, albeit tournament activity decreased whereas performance increased. Younger players were more involved in tournament activity and increased their performance at a faster pace than older players did. The dynamic change in tournament activity was a stronger predictor of the change in performance than the static cumulated amount of activity. Age and the change in tournament activity explained only half of the variation in the change in performance across the observed period.",

The book under construction is represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph, with chess positions as nodes and moves as directed arcs between nodes. Each position is given an absolute position probability that a game played between the given and being-constructed book will eventually reach that position. Books for White and Black are constructed separately. Assuming a book is being constructed for White, a position priority queue repeatedly chooses the highest-probability unexpanded position for expansion. If it is Black's turn to move, moves with move probabilities for the position are copied from the given book. If it is White's turn to move, a search determines the best move, which is added with move probability one. More-probable positions are searched to a greater depth. Several books for White, representing a range of build CPU time, were constructed to be used in play against the book that comes with Crafty version 25.0.1, CB25.0.1.

We argue against a narrow view of luck which includes only factors outside any player's control, and advocate for a holistic definition of luck as complementary to the variation in effective skill within a population of players. We introduce two metrics for luck in a game for a given population -one information theoretical, and one Bayesian, and discuss the estimation of these metrics using sparse, high-dimensional regression techniques.

      "1174": "The expertise effect in memory for chess positions is one of the most robust effects in cognitive psychology. One explanation of this effect is that chess recall is based on the recognition of familiar patterns and that experts have learned more and larger patterns. Template theory and its instantiation as a computational model are based on this explanation. An alternative explanation is that the expertise effect is due, in part, to stronger players having better and more conceptual knowledge, with this knowledge facilitating memory performance. Our literature review supports the latter view. In our experiment, a sample of 79 chess players were given a test of memory for chess positions, a test of declarative chess knowledge, a test of fluid intelligence, and a questionnaire concerning the amount of time they had played nontournament chess and the amount of time they had studied chess. We determined the numbers of tournament games the players had played from chess databases. Chess knowledge correlated .67 with chess memory and accounted for 16% of the variance after controlling for chess experience. Fluid intelligence accounted for an additional 13% of the variance.

Cognitive stimulating activities seem to be protective factors against dementia, though there is paucity in the scientific evidence confirming this, with most publications focusing on prevention in non-diagnosed people. A scoping review was conducted to explore whether chess practice could mitigate signs, deliver benefits, or improve cognitive capacities of individuals diagnosed with dementia through the available literature, and therefore act as a protective factor. Methods: twenty-one articles were selected after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: the overall findings stress that chess could lead to prevention in non-diagnosed populations, while little has been shown with respect to individuals already diagnosed. However, some authors suggest its capacity as a protective factor due to its benefits, and the evidence related to the cognitive functions associated with the game. Conclusion: although chess is indirectly assumed to be a protective factor due to its cognitive benefits, more studies are required to demonstrate, with strong evidence, whether chess could be a protective factor against dementia within the diagnosed population.",

AI advancements not only increase the importance of decision-making skills as complements, but also provide a new benchmark against which organizations will likely evaluate talent, given the alternative of seeking automation.

At a table holding the chessboard, a knight and a well-dressed woman are engaged in chess combat, while gathered around them are several onlookers and a scowling dwarf jester who commands the woman's attention. This essay examines the sources for Campi's unusual iconography, showing how he based his imagery on artistic and literary conventions fashioning chess as an allegory of love. While erotic fulfillment is thus the subtext of the game in progress, Campi's composition also betrays his knowledge of new rules of chess play. The queen was assigned increased powers, which led to the revised game being referred to as scacchi alla rabiosa, or \"mad chess.\" Campi alludes to this transformed game through the gestures and attributes of the female player-and her linkage with the \"mad\" dwarf jester.",

Chess agents designed for human-agent play are capable of adjusting their level, however their style is not aligned with that of human players. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for designing such agents by integrating the theory of chess players' decision-making with a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach using two sets of analyses. Quantitatively, we establish that the agents attain their desired Elo ratings.

However, the effects of long-term practice on functional network hubs in chess experts are largely undefined. Here, we investigated whether alterations of hubs can be detected in chess experts using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and graph theory methods. We first mapped the whole-brain voxel-wise functional connectivity and calculated the functional connectivity strength (FCS) map in each of the 28 chess players and 27 gender-and age-matched healthy novice players. Whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity analyses for the changed hub areas were conducted to further elucidate the corresponding changes of functional connectivity patterns in chess players. The hub analysis revealed increased FCS in the right posterior fusiform gyrus of the chess players, which was supported by analyses of this area's regional homogeneity (ReHo), amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), and fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF). The following functional connectivity analyses revealed increased functional connectivities between the right posterior fusiform gyrus and the visuospatial attention and motor networks in chess players. These findings demonstrate that cognitive expertise has a positive influence on the functions of the brain regions associated with the chess expertise and that increased functional connections might in turn facilitate within and between networks communication for expert behavior to get superior performance.",

The aim of the present study was to describe and compare the brain electrical activity pattern of chess players in two different situations under time pressure to make the move: rapid, 15 min, plus 10 s additional time per move and lightning, a one-minute game. Thus, lightning game offers an appropriate environment to isolate memory chunks and rapid game will offer the perspective of a working memory task. Encephalogram (EEG) recordings were obtained while a total of 14 male chess players (age: 35.36 \u00b1 13.77 and ELO: 1921.07 \u00b1 170.67) played lightning and rapid chess games. Results indicate that different activity patterns between the rapid and the lightning games were found. Increments in theta power during lightning game in posterior regions could indicate that theta power might be related with chunks retrieval. Moreover, right hemisphere is more activated in chess games, probably caused by visuospatial processing.

      "1208": "Humans tend to learn complex abstract concepts faster if examples are presented in a structured manner. For instance, when learning how to play a board game, usually one of the first concepts learned is how the game ends, i.e. the actions that lead to a terminal state (win, lose or draw). The advantage of learning end-games first is that once the actions which lead to a terminal state are understood, it becomes possible to incrementally learn the consequences of actions that are further away from a terminal state -we call this an end-game-first curriculum. Currently the state-of-the-art machine learning player for general board games, AlphaZero by Google DeepMind, does not employ a structured training curriculum; instead learning from the entire game at all times. By employing an end-game-first training curriculum to train an AlphaZero inspired player, we empirically show that the rate of learning of an artificial player can be improved during the early stages of training when compared to a player not using a training curriculum.",

Concrete presents several benefits for being used in this way, in particular with integrated electronic systems. This paper deals with smart concrete through a small size example, a chess game, i.e. board and pawns, to illustrate the potential applications on a larger scale in the field of construction. Different kind of sensors can be used in concrete construction. After comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each, magnetic sensors have been chosen to equip the concrete chessboard, handcrafted in the present work. The concrete used is UHPC (Ultra high performance concrete fiber reinforced or not), a new type of concrete with special properties, for the benefits of its mechanical strength and deformation, self-levelling workability and aesthetic surface rendering. Chess pawns and chess board have been cast with a specific protocol to embed the magnets and the sensor inside the concrete, by taking into account both its flocculation and setting times. Results of the tests show the feasibility to use magnetic sensors in concrete systems and show a good transmission of the magnetic signal through the concrete, which is very promising for further development of new concrete smart systems, that are easy and rentable to implement. The permeability of concrete to magnetic fields, robustness and sensitivity of sensor are the advantages of this application.",
      "1216": "Chess is an appropriate model to study ability and non-ability traits as related with performance because it bears intellectual and emotional demanding requirements. With a group of amateur chess players (n = 100), the current study addressed two interrelated aims. First, we assessed whether the three broad PEN personality factors (psychoticism, extraversion, and neuroticism), and emotion regulation traits (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) differentiated chess players from the general population. Second, we compared the association of domain knowledge and personality/emotion traits with chess skill. The main findings indicated that chess players scored lower in neuroticism and higher in expressive suppression compared with the general population. Moreover, chess knowledge related in a greater extent with chess skill than personality/emotion regulation traits, even though extraversion explained additional variability in chess skill. Overall, the findings suggest that nonability traits may be influential in the selection of the chess environment. Besides, the findings corroborate the stronger impact of cognitive ability than personality traits on intellectual performance found in other domains.",

Valuable chip area must be used to run wires connecting components on a chip and current packaging technology restricts the amount of communication that can cross chip boundaries. This paper presents a large parallel architecture for generating moves in chess and shows how it can be restructured to reduce communication and permit a straightforward VLSI implementation without any performance loss. The result is a move generator comprising 64 identical custom chips performing at a rate of 500,000 moves per second, performance that is comparable to the best existing move generator.",

For neither casual players (Experiment 1) nor tournament players (Experiment 2) did the placed pieces improve positioning of the remaining pieces. This result parallels the now standard finding of no facilitation through part-set cuing in the recall of word lists, and it bears on the question of whether this finding is due to memory for word lists not being organized or to the failure of the part-set cuing procedure to detect its organization. Specifically, to the extent that we can be more sure of memory for chess positions being organized than we can be of memory for word lists being organized, the present results provide evidence that the part-set cuing procedure does not test for memory organization.",

When dealing with parallel processing systems, communication delays are perhaps the greatest source of lost time. Therefore, an implementation of our tree decomposition based algorithm is presented that can operate with a limited amount of communication within a network of processors.

An initial set of experiments has been designed and run in an attempt to understand better the strengths and weaknesses of experiencebased learning from the point of view of skill refinement (taking less time to perform at a given level of play) and from the point of view of skill enhancement (higher quality play). Preliminary results suggest that in this context experienced-based learning can be a highly effective means for improving both the speed and quality of play without having to accumulate experience bases of intolerable size.",

The iterative deepening is unsynchronized-one processor might be in the middle of the fifth iteration while another is in the middle of the sixth.

      "1395": "Learning how to make decisions in a domain is a critical aspect of intelligent planning behavior. The ability of a planner to adapt its decision-making to a domain depends in part upon its ability to optimize the tradeoff between the sophistication of its decision procedures and their cost. Since it is difficult to optimize this tradeoff on a priori grounds alone, we propose that a planner start with a relatively simple set of decision procedures, and add complexity in response to experience gained in the application of its decision-making to real-world problems. Our model of this adaptation process is based on the explanation of failures, in that it is the analysis of bad decisions that drives the improvement of the decision procedures. We have developed a test-bed system for the implementation of planning models employing such an approach, and have demonstrated the ability of such a model to improve its procedure for projecting the effects of its moves in chess.",

      "1397": "This paper formalizes a new learning-from-examples problem: identifying a correct concept definition from positive examples such that the concept is some specialization of a target concept defined by a domain theory. It describes an empirical study that evaluates three methods for solving this problem: explanation-based generalization (EBG), multiple example explanation-based generalization (mEBG), and a new method, induction over explanations (IOE). The study demonstrates that the two existing methods (EBG and mEBG) exhibit two shortcomings: (a) they rarely identify the correct definition, and (b) they are brittle in that their success depends greatly on the choice of encoding of the domain theory rules. The study demonstrates that the new method, IOE, does not exhibit these shortcomings. This method applies the domain theory to construct explanations from multiple training examples as in mEBG, but forms the concept definition by employing a similarity-based generalization policy over the explanations. IOE has the advantage that an explicit domain theory can be exploited to aid the learning process, the dependence on the initial encoding of the domain theory is significantly reduced, and the correct concepts can be learned from few examples. The study evaluates the methods in the context of an implemented system, called Wyl2, which learns a variety of concepts in chess including \"skewer\" and \"knight-fork.\"",

      "1406": "Conventional parallelizations of the alpha-beta (cud) algorithm have met with limited success. Implementations suffer primarily from the synchronization and search overheads of parallelization. This paper describes a parallel (Y@ searching program that achieves high performance through the use of four different types of processes: Controllers, Searchers, TableManagers, and Scouts. Synchronization is reduced by having all Searchers apply the PVSplit algorithm on the subtrees they search and having a Controller process reassigning idle processes to help out busy ones. Search overhead is reduced by having two types of parallel table management: global Table Managers and the periodic merging and redistribution of local tables. Experiments show that nine processors can achieve 5.67-fold speedups but beyond that, additional processors provide diminishing returns. Given that additional resources are of little benefit, speculative computing is introduced as a means of extending the effective number of processors that can be utilized. Scout processes speculatively search ahead in the tree looking for interesting features and communicate this information back to the ~$3 program. In this way, the effective search depth is extended. These ideas have been tested experimentally and empirically as part of the chess program ParaPhoenk",

Previous work on assessing their performance has concentrated on the benefits of individual enhancements or a few combinations. However, each enhancement should not be taken in isolation; one would like to find the combination that provides the greatest reduction in tree size. Results indicate that the history heuristic and transposition tables significantly out-perform other alpha-beta enhancements in application generated game trees. For trees up to depth 8, when taken together, they account for over 99% of the possible reductions in tree size, with the other enhancements yielding insignificant gains.",

First, expected-outcome is considered in its ideal form, where it is shown to be a powerful heuristic. Next, the ability of a simple random sampler that estimates expected-outcome to outduel a standard Othello evaluator is demonstrated. Finally, the sampler is combined with a linear regression procedure to produce efficient expected-outcome estimators.

The reasoning process aiming at decisions among problem states associated with such a weighted pair is embedded in a traditional environment which requires point values.

The algorithms we develop were implemented on a 64K-processor CM-2 and used to solve certain natural classes of chess endgames, part of whose search space is invariant under a noncommutative crystallographic group. This program runs 400 times faster than any previous implementation, and discovered many interesting new results in the area; some of these results are not solvable in practice with current serial techniques because the time and space requirements are too large.

      "1464": "Rather than search exhaustively in large problem spaces, people use heuristics that entail minimal search and yet support intelligent decisions. Human performance in such spaces is robust and improves with experience. Game playing is a good example. The traditional AI approach to game playing, however, has been to build a program that plays only a single game, and plays it very well. Because exhaustive search of the game graph and minimax of the resultant values guarantees perfect play, programmed champions rely on deep, fast, efficient search. Despite their more limited, fallible memories and arguably slower processors, human masters often defeat a program whose search is incomplete. People search less, remember less, and somehow make the right choices. This paper describes HOYLE, a program that learns to play specific games under the direction of a weak theory, clearly delineated prior knowledge about games in general. HOYLE differs from most game-playing programs in two ways: it is able to play any of a broad class of games according to the rules, and it improves its performance through a variety of learning paradigms. HOYLE shows that, for a class of related problems, it is possible to replace deep search with a weak theory based upon heuristically selective cache memories and a consensus about action among reliable rationales.",

In Experiment 1, by means of a partitioning task, evidence was provided for a hierarchical representation of chess positions. Chess masters formed larger and more complex knowledge units than average players. In Experiment 2, the typicality of the positions was varied. The more typical the positions were, the larger and more coherent the constructed knowledge units were. The greatest differences between both groups occurred in more typical positions.

It was found at the end of the experiment that the group with unsolvable problems was more depressed than the two other groups.

There is no direct support for the theory, which omits forward search for reasons that are reexamined.

Confidence and ratings are negatively correlated, indicating that with lower ratings, players are overconfident. Skilled child players' predictions were better calibrated than any of the adults'.

Again, better child players were more accurate in their predictions and more accurate than adults. In the third study, child players were asked to predict their chances of winning in a non-chess domain after hearing a hypothetical win/loss history.

Our approach is based on the study of some examples of reactive agents applications. Their features arebriefly described and we underline, in each of them, what we call the emergent strategies obtained from the local interactions between the agents. Three examples are studied this way: the eco-problem-solving implementations of Pengi and the N-Puzzle, and the sociogenesis process occuring in the artificial ant colonies that compose the MANTA project. We then consider a typical strategical game (chess), and see how to decompose it through a distributed reactive approach called MARCH.

The lack of knowledge about the opponents' possible moves gives the game tree a very large branching factor, making the tree so immense that game-tree searching is infeasible. In this paper, we describe our approach for overcoming this problem. We develop a model of imperfect-information games, and describe how to represent information about the game using a modi ed version of a task network that is extended to represent multi-agency and uncertainty. We present a game-playing procedure that uses this approach to generate game trees in which the set of alternative choices is determined not by the set of possible actions, but by the set of available tactical and strategic schemes. In our tests of this approach on the game of bridge, we found that it generated trees having a much smaller branching factor than would have been generated by conventional game-tree search techniques. Thus, even in the worst case, the game tree contained only about 1300 nodes, as opposed to the approximately 6:01 10 44 nodes that would have been produced by a brute-force game tree search in the worst case. Furthermore, our approach successfully solved typical bridge problems that matched situations in its knowledge base. These preliminary tests suggest that our approach has the potential to yield bridge-playing programs much better than existing ones|and thus we have begun to build a full implementation.",

This model adds extra information in addition to the standard evaluation function. Within such a formal model, there is an optimal tree growth procedure and an optimal method of valueing the tree. We describe how to optimally value the tree, and how to approximate on line the optimal tree to search. Our tree growth procedure provably approximates the contribution of each leaf to the utility in the limit where we grow a large tree, taking explicit account of the interactions between expanding different leaves.

The effects of extended deliberate practice are more far-reaching than is commonly believed.

The overheads are classi ed into search o verhead, performance loss, and decrease of work load. Several mechanisms are investigated to cope with these overheads in order to achieve a high performance. We study a combination of local, medium range, and global load distribution strategies that does not only show a good behavior in terms of work load, but also has a positive in uence on the search o verhead. The e cient u s e of a virtual shared memory, that is distributed among the processors, shows also a big contribution to the overall performance of the system. A carefully restricted application of parallelism using an improved version of the Young Brothers Wait Concept (YBWC) leads to a perfect behavior for minimal Min/Max trees and to a quite low search o verhead, if well ordered trees are searched. Well ordered trees constitute the most important case in practice, since a couple of move ordering mechanisms are known that achieve a nearly optimal move ordering in many applications. The resulting combination of the methods shows an eciency better than any previous approach. Experiments carried out using 256 DeBruijn-connected Transputers result in a speedup of 142 even applying restricted timing constraints. With a system consisting of 1024 grid connected Transputers we obtain a speedup of 344. Moreover the algorithm shows a very good scalability, especially using interconnection networks with logarithmic diameter.

Therefore, with domain theories that lack rules, generalization is poor, and training can corrupt the original rules --even those that were initially correct. The paper presents TopGen, an extension to the KBANN algorithm, which heuristically searches for possible expansions to the KBANN network. TopGen does this by dynamically adding hidden nodes to the neural representation of the domain theory, in a manner that is analogous to the adding of rules and conjuncts to the symbolic rule base. Experiments indicate that the method is able to heuristically find effective places to add nodes to the knowledge bases of four real-world problems, as well as an artificial chess domain.

Twenty four subjects were allocated to a factorial design consisting of two levels of immersion (exocentric screen based, and egocentric HMD based), and two kinds of environment (plain and realistic. The results suggest that egocentric subjects performed better than exocentric, and those in the more realistic environment performed better than those in the less realistic environment.

In fact, each player knows the position of his own pieces, but he can only guess the position of enemy pieces. Each player tries to guess the position of the opponent's pieces as the game progresses by trying moves that can be either legal or illegal with respect to the real situation: a referee accepts legal moves and rejects illegal ones; the latter are useful to gain insight about the situation. This means that players have to play in a context of uncertainty and partial information. We know of no past attempts to build Kriegspiel playing programs. This paper describes the design of a program which plays a class of Kriegspiel positions using a knowledge base which implements a \"rational approach\". The program we have developed integrates two different notions of rationality introduced by Simon: the substantive and the procedural rationality [Sim76,Sim78]. The interesting part of such an experience is how the procedural rational approach can incorporate results obtained with substantive rationality, whereas the two approaches are usually considered alternative.",

A technique is proposed in which noisy examples are detected and eliminated from the training set, and a hypothesis is then built from the set of remaining examples. The separation of noise detection and hypothesis formation has the advantage that noisy examples do not influence hypothesis construction as opposed to most standard approaches to noise handling in which the learner typically tries to avoid overfitting the noisy example set.

Templates are \"chunks\" (Chase & Simon, 1973) that have evolved into more complex data structures and that possess slots allowing values to be encoded rapidly. Templates may facilitate search in three ways: (a) by allowing information to be stored into LTM rapidly; (b) by allowing a search in the template space in addition to a search in the move space; and (c) by compensating loss in the \"mind's eye\" due to interference and decay. A computer model implementing the main ideas of the theory is presented, and simulations of its search behaviour are discussed. The template theory accounts for the slight skill difference in average depth of search found in chess players, as well as for other empirical data.",

However, this information, although complete, is not in a form which is particularly useful to human beings. Therefore, the raw data inside an endgame database have to be transformed into knowledge in understandable form. This task concerning chess endgame databases is, in principle, the same as in KDD in general. This paper summarizes a few results from literature where knowledge (especially patterns) has been discovered for simple chess endgames -in most cases this has been done empirically, by intuition, and interacting with the computer, but not automatically. Up to now, there are almost no satisfying results for practical endgames to extract knowledge in an automatic way.

We conclude that for computer chess no practical alternative exists, but many promising ideas have good potential to change that in the future.",

In repeat learning the teacher chooses a series of related concepts randomly and independently from a distribution 29. A finite sequence of examples is provided for each concept in the series. The learner does not initially know 7), but progressively updates a posterior estimation of :D as the series progresses. This paper considers predicate invention within Inductive Logic Programming as a mechanism for updating the learner's estimation of :D. A new predicate invention mechanism implemented in Progol4.4 is used in repeat learning experiments within a chess domain. The results indicate that significant performance increases can be achieved. The paper develops a Bayesian framework and demonstrates initial theoretical results for repeat learning.",

      "1759": "For half a century since computers came into existence, the goal of finding elegant and efficient algorithms to solve ``simple'' (well-defined and well-structured) problems has dominated algorithm design. Over the same time period, both processing and storage capacity of computers have increased roughly by a factor of 10^6. The next few decades may well give us a similar rate of growth in raw computing power, due to various factors such as continuing miniaturization, parallel and distributed computing. If a quantitative change of orders of magnitude leads to qualitative changes, where will the latter take place? Many problems exhibit no detectable regular structure to be exploited, they appear ``chaotic'', and do not yield to efficient algorithms. Exhaustive search of large state spaces appears to be the only viable approach. We survey techniques for exhaustive search, typical combinatorial problems that have been solved, and present one case study in detail. Table of Contents 1. The Scope of Search Techniques 2.

We introduce a combination of the gaze contingent window paradigm and the \ufffd change blindness\ufffd flicker paradigm, and document dramatically larger visual spans for experts while processing structured, but not random, chess positions. In addition, in a check detection task, a minimized 3x3 chessboard containing a King and potentially checking pieces was displayed. In this task, experts made fewer fixations per trial, and had a greater proportion of fixations between individual pieces, rather than on pieces. Our results provide strong evidence for a perceptual encoding advantage for experts attributable to chess experience, rather than to a general perceptual or memory superiority.",

      "1763": "The paper discusses the relation between chess and philosophy, examining, among other things, how far chess might reveal important features of philosophical problemanalysis and argumentation. There is a plurality of scienti\u00ae c, philosophical, and other perspectives from which chess can be viewed. Some attention must be drawn to these various ways of conceptualizing the game, but the main emphasis of the paper lies in uncovering certain philosophically \u00b1 and metaphilosophically \u00b1 relevant basic assumptions of chess. It is argued that the thought patterns and reasoning procedures typical of chess seem to merge into those practised in philosophy. Moreover, we face in the comm on area of chess and other disciplines a multifarious possibility of research programmes, which promise to turn out useful both for the scienti\u00ae c and aesthetic understanding, and perhaps also for the chess tournament practice. Certain philosophical insights inspired by the practice of chess may lead us to transform our views about various complex human phenomena: not only about the nature of calculatory problem-solving and the relation between human intelligence and arti\u00ae cial intelligence, but also about ethical reasoning and even philosophical argumentation itself.",
      "1764": "Given the processing speed of the best chess computer is 200 million times faster in terms of positions evaluated per second than a h uman chess expert, a grandmaster, the question is not how can a computer beat a chess grandmaster but rather how d o c hess grandmasters beat computers? In computing terms, the human expert's strength lies in the ability to signi cantly prune the search tree and to correctly evaluate the resulting positions. This paper addresses the rst of these strengths and proposes an example-based reasoning mechanism to select candidate moves from a given chess position. The mechanism automatically generates an example-base from a database of grandmaster chess games using Principal Component Analysis to characterise the positions in the games database. Given a new position, its characterisation is compared to those in the example-base and a ranked list of n similar\" moves is returned. This forms the basis of an e ective forward pruning mechanism in a two player adversarial game.",
      "1766": "Reinforcement learning, in general, has not been totally successful at solving complex real-world problems which can be described by nonlinear functions. However, temporal difference learning is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that has been researched and applied to various prediction problems with promising results. This paper discusses the application of temporal-difference-learning in training a neural network to play a scaled-down version of Chinese Chess. Preliminary results show that this technique is favorable for producing desired results. In test cases where minimal factors of the game are presented, the network responds favorably. However, when introducing more complexity, the network does not function as well, but generally produces reasonable results. These results indicate that temporal difference learning has the potential to solve real-world problems of equal or greater complexity. Continuing research will most likely lead to more responsive and accurate systems in the future.",

So far, within LG, the game requirements (i.e., the description of the board, players, game pieces, the game rules, and the winning conditions) are described in a set-theoretical notation. Thus there is a need for a language suitable for formulating the game requirements by the end user. Since the aforementioned mathematical structures could be represented in terms of classes, objects, relations, and other object-oriented concepts in a natural way, we filled the above gap by providing a language for the game requirements on the basis of UML."

For each course and context, teachers decide what concepts will be taught, at what depth, and in what order, devise or select detailed examples for those concepts that are expected to raise more questions, and prepare an evaluation scheme to monitor the students' progress and understanding. In new courses most decisions can be based on the teacher's previous understanding of the course contents. Otherwise, these are frequently motivated by the teacher's previous experience in classrooms. In any case, they are certainly open to changes and improvements during the course itself.",

Each node and edge in a game tree represents a position and a move respectively. When programming a game with imperfect information, a node of a game tree represents a position, too. However, here we have the difficulty of representing uncertainty. Seen from a game-player's point of view, we would like to know precisely which positions are represented by that node and which are not. To deal with this problem we use information sets arising from the uncertainty that characterizes nodes in the search. Recently, we proposed a novel deterministic approach for solving problems with uncertainty, called Uncertainty Paradigm Search (UPS) ",

Based on static source code analysis, Pangaea first takes an abstract decision how a given program should be distributed, such that certain requirements and optimization criteria are fulfilled. The distribution strategy thus obtained indicates which objects should be placed onto which node, when and how object migration is to be employed, etc. Pangaea then realizes that strategy by transforming the program's source code for a given distribution platform, trying to make good use of the abilities and features of that platform. Pangaea can therefore be considered a distributing compiler: the source language is pure Java, without any restrictions or added constructs, the target language is the distributed Java variant of the chosen distribution platform.",

In this capacity, games have long been used as a testbed for general AI research and ideas. In particular, chess has a long history of use because of its strategic complexity, and well-studied and understood properties. Despite these advantages, chess has two significant drawbacks as a general AI testbed: the first is the success of computer chess players that use hard-coded, domain specific rules and strategies to play; and the second is the fact that standard chess is a perfect information domain. A number of researchers have tackled the first of these drawbacks. For example Berliner ",

Rather than relying on mouse or keyboard, direct manipulation of virtual objects is enabled by employing tracking with six degrees of freedom (6DOF). Frequently, this is done via handheld props (such as flying mouse or wand) that are fitted with magnetic trackers. However, this technology can only offer limited quality because it is inherently tethered, inaccurate and susceptible to magnetic interference. Early on, optical tracking has been proposed as an alternative. One main reason why optical tracking is so attractive is because unlike tethered magnetic tracking it supports capturing human movement without the need for active sensors, thus allowing interaction without the use of props. In particular, the tracking of hands is relevant, because it allows natural gesturing (Figure ",

On the other hand, little is known of Chinese chess endgame databases in comparable scale until recently [9,10].

This was a consequence of increasing the mobility of the pieces, without diluting it over a larger board. Modern Chess is played with a small set of pieces on a geometrically simple board, and while its rules can be mastered by children, it quickly becomes mind-bogglingly complex. This makes it as challenging for the grandmaster as it is for the beginner. FIDE's stabilization of the game did not, of course, eliminate all variations or end attempts to \"improve\" it, but thus far, modifications have produced only curiosities (if not monstrosities.) Trivial changes don't seem worth bothering about, and significant changes destroy the virtues of the original game. One is tempted to say that Chess has reached a perfection. In any case, any plausible modification must preserve its two crucial characteristics: formal simplicity and substantive complexity. It is with this in mind, that we have developed Circular Chess.",

As the game progresses, each player tries to guess the position of his opponent's pieces by trying moves to which the referee can stay silent, if the move is legal, or he can announce \"illegal move\", if the move is illegal. Then the player has to make another try. If the move is legal and it gives check or captures a piece, the referee says \"check\" or \"capture\", respectively.

This is due to the fact that board games offer a fixed environment, easy measurement of taken actions (result of the game) and enough complexity. AI-search algorithms also play an important role in game playing programs. Learning takes place by showing database games of strong human players to our agent. We make use of database games because this saves a lot of time compared to playing against itself or against an other opponent. Watching a database game takes less than a second, while playing a game itself consumes much more time. This is because database games are al-ready played, it is therefore not necessary for the agent to search for moves to be played. This saves thousands of evaluation function calls per move.

A standard softwareengineering approach for verifying that new modifications do not break existing code is to use regression testing. To a large extent that approach is what gameplaying program developers use. They keep around large suites of test positions and verify that a modified program evaluates them correctly and plays the correct move. Additionally, new program versions play a large number of games against different computer opponents to verify that the newly added enhancements result in genuine improvements. Nonetheless, especially when it comes to the search, it can be difficult to detect abnormalities and they may stay hidden for a long time without surfacing. These can be subtle things such as the search extending useless lines too aggressively, or poor move ordering resulting in unnecessarily late cutoffs. Neither of the above abnormalities result in erroneous results, but may instead degrade the effectiveness of the search unnecessarily.",

We assume players to weakly prefer a higher rank over a lower one and to be indifferent as to the other players' ranks. This type of situation is commonly encountered in parlor games, competitions, patent races, competitive resource allocation domains, social choice settings, or any other strategic situation where players are merely interested in performing optimal relative to their opponents rather than in absolute measures. Formally, ranking games are defined as normal-form games in which the payoff function represents the players' von Neumann-Morgenstern preferences over lotteries over rankings.

A unique situation arises with programs that implement artificial intelligences to play a well-known game, typically a board game like chess or go, or a card game like poker. These programs have a considerable market and by necessity share common traits since they all play by the same rules; plagiarism cases and accusations follow almost automatically from these premises. The situation can only worsen under a competitive scenario pitting these AIs against each other and allowing the general public to compare their moves. This paper stems from involvement in the examination of chess programs for the purpose of plagiarism detection and fitness for tournament participation under antiplagiarism rules.

It has several features that make it interesting: firstly, its rules are identical to those of a very well-known game and only the players' perception of the board is different, only being able to see their own pieces; secondly, it is a game with a huge number of states and limited means of acquiring information; and finally, the nature of uncertainty is entirely dynamic. This differs from other games such as Phantom Go or Stratego, wherein a newly discovered piece of information remains valid for the rest of the game.

However, in chess, unlike many other sports, it is possible to assess the strength of each move, at least subjectively, based on some sort of positional evaluation. In principle, by evaluating the positions on the board before and after a move was made, it is possible to assess whether the move was good or bad. Of course, straightforward approaches to position evaluation -such as summing up the value of material on the board -will not work since, for example, in the middle of a piece exchange the material may appear to be temporarily unbalanced. A position should therefore be evaluated on the basis of its potential, and this can be done by studying the main lines that arise from that position. Assuming that both players will always choose the best possible moves, the problem of evaluating a given position is recursive since it requires evaluating the new positions that can arise from the given one. Chess programs make use of a recursive algorithm known as minimax, which performs a kind of tree-based search in order to find the best move. 2 The best move has an assigned score that corresponds to the best position that can arise out of the current one, assuming that both players play best moves throughout.

In this paper we focus on attractiveness. In practice, it can be hard to get reliable data on outcomes regarding risk and attractiveness. Options as well as outcomes are not always easily defined when decisions are made outside of the laboratory, and as Eckel and Wilson  (2004) discuss, physical appearance could be used as a heuristic when people try to form an opinion about an unfamiliar individual's ability and characteristics. It can therefore be a challenge to disentangle attractiveness from for example beliefs about ability. We argue that the data used in this paper enables us to disentangle the specific effect of attractiveness on risk taking, by allowing us to study relevant outcome variables while controlling for aspects such as ability.

Trying to replicate or mimic these processes on a computer is futile given our current lack of understanding of these processes and abstractions that humans use.

By subsequently backing up through this tree of moves, a player can find the best move for his side by using the minimax algorithm. Minimax search assumes that the players will always select the alternative that is best for them in any given position. The advantage of such an approach is that it guarantees perfect play; a \"winning\" position will always be won, and a drawn position will at least be drawn.

These losses are due to search overhead and communication overhead. The search overhead is algorithm dependent, since it is defined as the extra work that a parallel algorithm carries out compared to its sequential counterpart. Since an alpha-beta search uses accumulated information to determine when cutoffs are to occur, a parallel implementation may have one processor still calculating the better cutoff value that another processor could use to terminate its execution. Thus the total work done, and hence the search overhead, may be higher. In contrast, communication overhead results from the necessary exchange of information between processors, and is therefore dependent on the system configuration as well as the algorithm.

The reason that ideas such as board control do not appear in major chess programs is that board control correlates very highly with piece placement.

For the purpose of this paper we do not need to give the complete rules of the game. It suffices to say that kriegspiel is the game of chess in which the players are not informed of their opponent's moves. Instead, each player keeps track of the position of his own pieces and tries to gain information about the position of the opponent's pieces as the game progresses. There is a referee who controls the game by keeping track of the true position and by telling the player whose turn it is to move, whether a proposed move is a legal chess move or not, using the word \"no\" to indicate an illegal move. In addition, when a legal move puts a player's king in check, the referee announces this fact to both players and specifies the direction of the check. In our case, this essentially means that he announces whether the check is by the bishop or the knight or both.",

For example, powerful vector processors are now well established and most contemporary systems use some degree of pipelining, but have the disadvantage that applications must be specially tailored to the hardware design.

      "1476": "Amid the vast literature on poor decision-making and the limits of rationality, research on chess cognition stands out as a prime example of the excellence of human judgment. It is difficult to believe that 12-and 13-year-olds become chess masters and that children as young as 6 and 7 compete against adult players and earn quite respectable chess ratings. At first blush, one is tempted to label these children \"idiot savants\" with some special, and exceedingly rare, chess talent. But there are simply too many competent child players -even in the United States where chess players of any ilk are rare. Models of chess skill must be able to account for high levels of competence among chil-dren. Also, understanding how children acquire their skill may have important practical implications for the enhancement of other types of learning.",

The IBM programming team of Feng-hsiung Hsu and Murray Campbell had used only two processors last year when DEEP THOUGHT/88 managed to tie for first place, but this year, with an additional year of software improvements and much improved hardware, their program clearly dominated the competition. It was carrying out brute-force searches on most moves to a depth of ten levels (five moves for each side) and deeper along tactical lines. During endgame play, it searched even deeper. On average, DEEP THOUGHT II examined 5,000,000 chess positions per second. With moves made at an average rate of 180 seconds per move, 900,000,000 chess positions were searched by the program when making a move.",
      "1479": "Appartenendo all'onorata categoria scacchistica dei \"polli\" ho una naturale indulgenza verso chi, avendo perso, parla di circostanze avverse o addirittura di \"sfortuna\". Questo non toglie che a prima vista i luoghi comuni circa l'assenza di questo fattore dagli scacchi siano attendibili. Per affrontare I'argomento occorre anzitutto sovrapporre al concetto vago di \"fortuna\" del senso comune un concetto rigorosamente definito: sar\u00e0, se lo si far\u00e0 con giovani scacchisti o aspiranti matematici, una delle tante occasioni per mostrare che uno dei vantaggi della matematica \u00e8 proprio quello di fornire strumenti per sovrapporre ai concetti del senso comune concetti rigorosamente definiti. Supponiamo, si dir\u00e0, di essere in una situazione cui possono seguirne altre: s1,s2,....,sn, di probabilit\u00e0 rispettive p1, p2,...,pn; si chiama allora \"speranza\" o \"utilit\u00e0 la somma u=p1 v1+P2 v2+...+Pn vn. Supponiamo ora che di fatto si verifichi una situazione, fra quelle elencate come possibili, di valore v; sembra abbastanza aderente al senso comune chiamare fortuna (del protagonista, in quella circostanza) la differenza v -u e, se vogliamo, sfortuna il suo opposto u -v. Se si vuole che questa teoria risulti applicabile conviene che le probabilit\u00e0 e i valori siano presi in un opportuno campo non archimedeo, che il valore 0 sia riservato agli eventi impossibili e il valore 1 agli aventi D certi. Tornando agli scacchi occorre anzitutto chiarire che il gioco \u00e8 determinato, nel senso che si verifica una (e una sola) delle seguenti possibilit\u00e0: a) Esiste una strategia vincente per il Bianco; b) Esiste una strategia vincente per il Nero; c) Esistono due strategie di patta, una per il Bianco e una per il Nero.",

I shall then offer five examples of the playing of chess, ethnographic situations that are familiar to me from many years of participant observation and writing about the game ",
      "1494": "The board game go is one of the grand challenges of game related artificial intelligence. While go is a finite, perfect information game, its game tree is prohibitively large for tree searches. The situation in go is perhaps best compared with that in chess, which has been called \"the drosophila of artificial intelligence\", meaning that a multitude of key problems of artificial intelligence appear in chess and can be studied there. Currently, the best chess playing programs rely heavily on large scale tree searches and use a comparatively small amount of chess knowledge. In go it is the other way round, i.e. the quality of the go knowledge is the determining factor. Due to the structure of go, strong go programs emphasize much more the human way of thinking about go rather than brute force methods for which computers are ideal, and from this point of view one could argue that go is a much more interesting problem than chess. Many important advances have been made in go regarding the application of rule based knowledge representations, pattern recognition and machine learning. For a recent, lucid review of computer go see ",
      "1497": "In military science as well as in everyday life, building a strategy usually means making a plan of coordinated actions for reaching a particular goal. It often refers to situations in which (1) the goal to reach is possibly conflicting with the goal of another agent and (2) different resources must be employed, sometimes concurrently, in order to reach it. A strategy always relies on two strong assumptions: having a view as global as possible of the current situation, and making sure that the resources will perform the desired actions. That is why military have always payed a great attention to develop intelligence services, in order to obtain as much information as they can, and to establish strong hierarchies, in order to be obeyed on the battlefield. But that is also why famous battles have been lost. The best example could be that of the battle of Waterloo, during which the late arrival of Grouchy, due to both a lack of information and a misunderstanding of orders, has ruined the whole strategy established by Napoleon and its generals. In that respect, the disadvantages of a long term strategy are quite clear (note that these critics can be applied to plans, in the AI acceptation of the term, see ",

With considerable success, researchers have been trying to create computer chess programs to equal or surpass the best human chess players. Most of these programs are based on the idea of carrying out massive amounts of search through a huge tree of potential moves and counter-moves.

      "1509": "The event began with remarks by Bruce Mazlish, an MIT professor and author of the book \"The Fourth Discontinuity: The Co-evolution of Humans and Machines,\" and Paul Sullivan of Intel. Chief Arbiter Joel Salman conducted the drawing of lots using numbered, colored diskettes. International Masters Maurice Ashley and Danny Kopec provided commentary during and between the rounds. Play proceeded throughout the morning and afternoon with no significant incidents. There was considerable media coverage of the event, including a segment on an ABC News Nightline episode devoted entirely to chess. Several hundred spectators watched the games on demonstration boards (often looking at the clocks as well), tried two of the programs (Kasparov's Gambit and BattleChess 4000 SVGA) on demonstration machines provided by the IBM PC Company, and toured The Computer Museum, the only museum of its kind in the world.",
      "1510": "The computer chess community has long had a need for a comprehensive test suite of chess positions for the purposes of debugging and evaluating chess playing programs. Such a suite can also be useful (if it is comprehensive enough) for nding out what areas of play one's program is weak in, so that one may then improve the program in those areas. A third use of test suites was apparently invented by the authors (D. Dailey and L. Kau man) of the program \\Socrates II\" which recently won the 23rd ACM computer chess championship. This is to take a set of test positions which y ou know y our program is capable of solving (a subset of our set might be used) and to then postulate that the strength, in rating points, of your program is a monotonic function of the runtime it requires to solve the problems in this set. One then tunes the program's selective search heuristics to reduce this runtime.",
      "1513": "Over the last years parallel computing has received considerable attention of researchers in science and engineering. Among others, the main reasons for the growing interest are the difficulties to increase the performance of sequential computers due to tedmical and physical limitations. Furthermore, the availability of cheap mass fabricated microprocessors and communication switches makes it more economical to connect hundreds and thousands of these components than to build highly specialized sequential computers. Theoretically, such a collection of processors working in parallel can achieve unbounded performance and is therefore suitable to solve problems of all areas of science and engineering. Among these are, for example, eomputationally intensive problems like weather forecasting and computational fluid dynamics or real time problems like vision and speech recognition. A number of different architectures for the construction of parallel computers have been proposed. Flynn ",
      "1517": "Of the brute-force searches, depth-rst iterative-deepening DFID is the most practical, because it combines breadth-rst optimality with the low space complexity of depth-rst search. Its basic idea is as simple as conducting a series of independent depth-rst searches, each with the look-ahead horizon extended by an additional tree level. With the iterative approach, DFID is guaranteed to nd the shortest solution path, just as a breadth-rst search w ould. But in contrast to the latter, DFID needs negligible memory space. Its space complexity grows only linearly with the search depth.",

      "1525": "Computers are having a signi cant impact on the game of chess. There are many computers which p l a y c hess, and some of these have e v en achieved the skill of a weak grandmaster 2]. There is software which stores games in a database which can then be used to study various openings or can be used to analyze the style of play of a future opponent 1 ]. What we will consider in this paper is the use of computers to create an endgame database 9]. In the endgame there are a small number of pieces left on the chess board, and one can imagine describing all the correct lines of play. For the chess community such databases provide unequivocally correct move sequences from any position in the database, and have b e e n u s e d t o c hallenge accepted wisdom about the outcome of various games. For the computer scientist endgames provide an interesting and open-ended computational problem -when all n-piece endgames have been solved we need only go on to consider n+1-piece games. All 5-piece endgame databases 5] and almost all pawnless 6-piece databases 4] h a ve been created, although archival storage of the latter is not available. This paper is primarily directed at an audience normally dealing with scienti c computations such as computational uid dynamics. In contrast to those problems, endgame database construction involves parallel logical op-erations on sets of bits. In the hope that it will be instructive for those doing large scale scienti c computations, we present the basic algorithms in some detail in the form of code fragments. and we discuss how these perform for smaller endgames on two supercomputers, the Connection Machine CM-2 6], and the Cray YMP8/128. The algorithm was originally devised for the Connection ",
      "1526": "This book is a sign of its times. Each one of the chapters -papers written by European authors of various backgrounds -illustrates a departure from the style of theorizing that has been prominent in the social sciences for most of the century. Until very recently, models for behavioral phenomena were chiefly based on numerical representations of the objects of concern, e.g. the subjects and the stimuli under study. This was due in large part to the influence of nineteenth century physics, which played the role of the successful older sister, the one that had to be imitated if one wished to be taken seriously in scientific circles. The mystical belief that there could be science only when the objects of concern were susceptible of measurement in the sense of physics was a credo that could not be violated without risks. Another, more honorable justification was that the numerical models were the only ones capable of feasible calculations. (In fact, these models were typically linear.) An early example of such theorizing in psychology is factor analysis, which attempted to represent the results of mental tests in a real vector space of small dimensionality, each subject being represented by a point in that space. A dimension was interpreted as a scale measuring some mental ability. The analysis was simple, and only required an electrical desk calculator (with spinning wheels), and a suitable amount of determination. Psychometric models and practices, which are currently the object of much criticisms, are in the same vein.",

      "1531": "Chess is one of the most popular examples of two persons zero-sum games, i.e., games which one player's loss is his opponent's gain. There are a number of methods for programming a computer to play such games ",
      "1532": "Modern networked systems make available more and more computing power at cheaper prices, and this encourages the development of CPU-bound distributed AI programs which exploit the new hardware. Chess-playing programs are certainly CPU-bound, but they are also difficult to parallelize. In fact, to build a strong parallel chess program is much more difficult than building a strong sequential chess program, because there are many special problems introduced by parallelism: most heuristics developed to improve the performance of parallel alphabeta do not scale well to parallel implementations ",
      "1533": "The alphabeta algorithm is the basis of most playing programs that search game trees. Its efficiency is decisive in programs based on brute-force search. For instance, some experiments found that improving five times the running time of the alphabeta algorithm the playing strength of a chess program improves about 200 Elo points ",
      "1534": "In the field of game tree search the alpha-beta algorithm has been in use since the 1950's. It has proven quite successful, mainly due to the good results that have been achieved by programs that use it. No other algorithm has achieved the wide-spread use in practical applications that alpha-beta has.",

The parallelism in computer chess is derived from a dynamic expansion of a highly irregular game-tree, which makes computer chess difficult to express, for example, as a data-parallel program. To investigate how to program this sort of dynamic MIMD-style application, we engineered a parallel chess program called *Socrates (pronounced \"Star-Socrates\".) The program, based on Heuristic Software's serial Socrates program, has an informally estimated rating of over 2400 USCF. *Socrates, running on the 512node CM-5 at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois, tied for third place in the 1994 ACM International Computer Chess Championship held at the end of June 1994 in Cape May, New Jersey.",

      "1552": "Neural networks may be applied well in a lot of practical areas, such as visual pattern recognition, voice recognition or voice synthesis. So far only a few work has been done to use neural networks in game playing, e. g. backgammon and bridge (see [TESAURO/SEJNOWSKI 891, [KOHLE/SCHONBAUER 891). In the authors' opinion, so far no efforts have been made in the game of chess. The game of chess as a whole is actually too complex for training a neural network. So we selected only a small endgame where complete knowledge is available. The aim of this project was to transform this complete information (of a small subfield from the game of chess) into a neural network. Chapter 2 describes the chess endgame white Queen against black King (with certain additional conditions). From this we obtain the input and output data for training the network. In chapter 3 the structure of the network is explained. Chapter 4 gives experimental results using a neural network simulator and discusses the experiments.",
      "1554": "OF the brute-force searches, depth-rst iterative-deepening DFID is the most practical, because it combines breadthrst optimality with the low space complexity of depthrst search. Its basic idea is as simple as conducting a series of independent depth-rst backtracking searches, each with the look-ahead horizon extended by an additional tree level. With the iterative approach, DFID is guaranteed to nd the shortest solution path, just as a breadth-rst search w ould. But in contrast to the latter, DFID needs negligible memory space. Its space complexity grows only linearly with the search depth.",

After having carefully analyzed Stockman's SSS* algorithm, Roizen and Pearl came to the conclusion Yes and no\" 19 , while Marsland, Reinefeld and Schae er presented Low overhead alternatives to SSS*\" 11 . Even so, state space search methods are seldomly used in practice, because of their substantial space requirements and the corresponding CPU-time overheads needed for the bookkeeping of the best-rst node information.",

This paper follows the same line, but concentrates on a very special class of chess problems known as \"helpmates\". These problems are generally more complex than normal problems since the two sides cooperate and thus there is no requirement for forcing variations. One relatively new area of research i n volves the use of constraints to reduce the problem space. As we shall see this idea can be applied successfully to helpmate problems. Logic Programming can serve a s a c o n venient programming scheme for constraint systems. So it is no surprise to meet Prolog-like languages in this eld. Several speci c constraint systems are available. To distinguish from other systems (for instance working over Boolean constraints), arithmetic constraints are characterised by restricting variables to numeric values. One of the rst attempts to use Constraint Logic Programming in the chess domain was done about two y ears ago 1] using the CLP(R) 1 . 2 system 2]. Unfortunately, CLP(R) processes linear constraints over oating point n umbers, which i s n o t v ery convenient in the nite domain of a chessboard. Therefore, the use of a constraint system with nite domains is more straightforward and investigations continue using the Oz system to this ",

The main idea was to replace a one-level complex system, as the game of chess use to be seen, by a multi-level hierarchical model that could allow us to break the system into subsystems, to search these subsystems separately and in combinations, and then combine optimal solutions for subsystems as approximately optimal for the entire system. This approach reduced the search drastically, down to a hundred of moves. However, the main difficulty was transferred from the development of efficient search methods to the design of methods for implementation of this decomposition.",

      "1652": "This paper describes an experiment to compare task performance of twenty-four subjects with respect to immersive and non-immersive participation and interaction in a virtual environment (VE). Subjects participated in and observed a sequence of events played out in relation to a complex geometrical structure, and their task was the subsequent reproduction of those events with respect to the real world equivalent of that structure. Half the subjects participated in a visually immersive VE, and the remainder in a nonimmersive VE. A secondary independent variable was the realism of the displayed environment. The task involved the reproduction of moves of pieces in the Tri-Dimensional chess game popularised in the TV series Star Trek. One inspiration of this work was the question posed by ",
      "1653": "1.1 Three ways to valuate a tree: BP, AB, and PP In a companion paper 7] , we proposed a Bayesian procedure for making computers play games such as chess. We call this procedure \\BP\". The BP approach both values a given search tree di erently (each n o d e is associated with a probability distribution, rather than a number themove with largest mean is chosen) and grows a more selective tree (leaves with large \\expansion importance\" based on certain Bayesian principles, are expanded) than standard approaches. Shannon 49] proposed that computers select their move according to the minimax value of a full width subtree, with numerical leaf values assigned by some readily computed, heuristic evaluation function. The alpha-beta (AB) procedure speeds up the minimaxing. Various heuristic improvements such as \\move ordering\" and \\iterative deepening\" allow alpha-beta to achieve in practice nearly its theoretical limit speed up, i.e. to search i n a given time nearly twice as deep a full width tree as would be searched by a naive tree searcher. Other heuristics attempt to extend search along hopefully important lines or retract search on hopefully unimportant lines. Alpha-beta, with heuristic improvements, has been the search engine in virtually every high-performance game program since its invention, including games of chess, checkers, and Othello where computers are comparable to or better than human experts",
      "1657": "Current computer chess machines implement opening books to guide the opening moves of chess games. These books consume system space and are purely tactical in nature, suggesting moves that follow a particular sequence that is recorded in the opening book. The use of books does not permit the development of strategy until the book is no longer in use. This means that computer chess systems cannot utilize heuristic domain knowledge for strategic planning until after the opening moves have already occurred, which can be as late as the tenth or even twelfth move of a game for complicated opening sequences. ",

During the past few years, parallel algorithms have evolved from fixed master-slave relationships, where the master looked for slaves to complete its task, to more dynamic master-slave relationships, where unemployed processors look for a master in order to find some task to do.

An efficient problem solver would need to transform those rules into a near-optimal policy for choosing moves in the game. Similarly, the problem of job-shop scheduling can be solved by a simple problem solver that generates and tests all possible schedules.

      "1764": "Computer Chess has long been viewed as a test bed for Arti cial Intelligence and the work in this area has added greatly to our repertoire of search algorithms 1 6 . Today, the best chess computer, Deep Blue II, can successfully challenge the world's leading player. If we examine how Deep Blue II achieved this we see that it was mainly based on the application of brute force methods. Deep Blue II still looks at all legal moves in a position, and using clever\" brute force techniques, crunches through all the possibilities. However, with its hardware assisted move generation and evaluation, Deep Blue II is capable of examining 200 million positions per second. To a large extent it is this combination of brute force and speed that has led to Deep Blue II's success. When you compare Deep Blue II's processing speed to the average speed of a chess grandmaster, 1 position per second, the question is not how can a computer beat a chess grandmaster but rather how d o c hess grandmasters beat computers? Early studies 7 showed that grandmasters rarely search more than 100 branches in any position and that on the basis of search statistics alone, it is very hard to tell if a search was performed by a grandmaster or an average club player. Grandmasters did not look at signi cantly more variations than the average club player did, they just look at the most signi cant v ariations, and hence selected better moves. In computing terms, a human grandmaster's strength lies in the ability to significantly prune the search tree and to correctly evaluate the resulting positions. This paper addresses the rst of these strengths and uses example-based reasoning as the mechanism to select candidate moves from a given chess position. A database of games played by the best human chess grandmasters is analysed using a multivariate technique called Principal Component Analysis in order to characterise each of the positions that occurred in the grandmaster games in an instance space. Given a new position, the instance space is searched and a ranked list of moves played by grandmasters in similar\" positions is returned.",
      "1766": "Neural networks have been widely implemented for solving various problems, mostly classification, pattern recognition, and function approximations. However, they have not been researched as extensively in the \"science\" of games. This shortcoming may be due to two reasons. Games may be considered trivial subjects not worthy of serious research, and neural networks have not yet evolved into a precise science. Thus, complex problems such as those presented by strategic games cannot be readily fed into a generic neural network and be expected to output reasonable results. There are many areas in neural networks that have yet to be discovered and explored in order to sufficiently handle or even solve complex problems. Artificial intelligence (AI) today is just that --artificial, and only capable of solving a fraction of what genuine intelligence (humans) can solve. Therein lies the justification for designing neural networks to play games and solve puzzles. Though they may seem to not yield any obvious applications in other fields, through this research new learning methods may be developed that can be applied to similar real-life problems and new insights may be gained.",
      "1767": "This paper addresses the key issue of goal decomposition schemes for HTN Adversarial Planning and suggests that the knowledge of relationships and interactions between goals is the key in uence in deciding upon a decomposition scheme. We describe an approach which uses \\early grounding\" to cope with these interactions, which i n a n a d v ersarial domain are generally very signi cant. We also highlight the possibility of adding data driven aspects into such a system which m a y be essential in some domains (Go almost certainly being one). The planning architecture performed well when it was ap-plied to the game of Go, a very complex game-playing do-main. This demonstrates that the HTN Adversarial Planning approach can be useful for such hard problems. Section 1.1 introduces HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) Adversarial Planning, outlines the general approach adopted here and presents Go as a complex test domain. Section 2 describes the form of an adversarial plan. Section 3 gives an overview of the planning architecture. Section 4 focuses on the goal decomposition schemes which are the heart of the planning system. Sections 5 and 6 give results of applying the architecture to Go followed by conclusions.",
      "1769": "The Linguistic Geometry (LG) approach to complex systems was introduced by B. Stilman in the early 80s. It was successfully employed by a team of researchers in Moscow, Russia to solve a number of difficult test problems in Artificial Intelligence for such areas as chess and power equipment maintenance scheduling. Recent research in LG "
