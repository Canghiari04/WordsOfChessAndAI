Here we provide a\nquantitative definition of the variance of quantum coherent fluctuations (the\nquantum variance) of any observable on generic quantum states. The quantum\nvariance generalizes the concept of thermal de Broglie wavelength (for the\nposition of a free quantum particle) to the space of eigenvalues of any\nobservable, quantifying the degree of coherent delocalization in that space.\nThe quantum variance is generically measurable and computable as the difference\nbetween the static fluctuations and the static susceptibility of the\nobservable; despite its simplicity, it is found to provide a tight lower bound\nto most widely accepted estimators of \"quantumness\" of observables (both as a\nfeature as well as a resource), such as the Wigner-Yanase skew information and\nthe quantum Fisher information. When considering bipartite fluctuations in an\nextended quantum system, the quantum variance expresses genuine quantum\ncorrelations (of discord type) among the two parts. In the case of many-body\nsystems it is found to obey an area law at finite temperature, extending\ntherefore area laws of entanglement and quantum fluctuations of pure states to\nthe mixed-state context.
