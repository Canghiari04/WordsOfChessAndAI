         "Introduction": "Imitation is one of the most important mechanisms whereby knowledge may be transferred and skills acquired between agents (both biological and artificial). It requires two or more agents sharing a context that allows one agent to imitate another. Imitation involves reproducing observed actions and/or effects in an appropriate context. A comprehensive treatment of imitation needs to examin the actions, effects, context and goals of the participating agents. An interdisciplinary framework treating imitation formally is presented in "

Actually, intelligent tutoring systems research is concerned with the development of computer tools that show adaptive capabilities in the domain of tutoring, where the student's progress is autonomously monitored and guided according to some tutoring strategy. This paper provides details on the analysis, design and implementation of such a system. STIA (Sistema Tutor en Internet de Ajedrez) is a fully implemented Web-based tool developed to provide adaptive guidance and help while learning chess basics. In STIA the task of the tutor is to guide the student efficiently through the course material, according to the tutoring strategy defined by the course authors. This is achieved in two ways. First, it imposes limits on the portion of course material the students can access. This prevents them from getting lost in a flood of information. Second, the tutor evaluates each student's knowledge through a set of problems, and according to result recommends reviewing theory, solving more problems or advancing through the course.",
         "Introduction": "Courses are a common way to organize teaching at a high level. For each course and context, teachers decide what concepts will be taught, at what depth, and in what order, devise or select detailed examples for those concepts that are expected to raise more questions, and prepare an evaluation scheme to monitor the students' progress and understanding. In new courses most decisions can be based on the teacher's previous understanding of the course contents. Otherwise, these are frequently motivated by the teacher's previous experience in classrooms. In any case, they are certainly open to changes and improvements during the course itself."

Sutton [Machine Learning 3 (1988)  9\u00b144] introduced the TD(k) method which is an elegant integration of supervised learning with TD learning. TD(k) enabled Tesauro\u00d5s backgammon program to reach world championship standard. But it can be slow. Tesauro\u00d5s program was trained on 1 500 000 games. Recent work [D.F. Beal, M.C. Smith, Temporal coherence and prediction decay in temporal dierence learning. Technical Report no. 756, Department of Computer Science, Queen Mary and West\u00aeeld College, University of London, 1998] has described a signi\u00aecant algorithmic improvement (temporal coherence) that controls learning rates, and produces more stable \u00aenal values. Results from a random walk task, and two complex real-world games are presented here to show that temporal coherence (TC) produces faster learning than earlier methods, and that TD learning can produce values that are superior to standard values for speci\u00aeed search regimes, without any domain-speci\u00aec information or human assistance. In the chess domain, we also describe the emergence of classic human elementary knowledge in the pattern of weights learnt from self-play, starting with weights initialised to zero.",

This estimates the distance to goal in single-agent searches, or the value of a game-state in competitive (zero-sum) tasks.

In an indirect way, this resembles the human thinking process.

However, that number was meant more as a rough estimate and a rhetorical device than as a real capacity limit. Others have since suggested that there is a more precise capacity limit, but that it is only three to five chunks. The present target article brings together a wide variety of data on capacity limits suggesting that the smaller capacity limit is real. Capacity limits will be useful in analyses of information processing only if the boundary conditions for observing them can be carefully described. Four basic conditions in which chunks can be identified and capacity limits can accordingly be observed are: (1) when information overload limits chunks to individual stimulus items, (2) when other steps are taken specifically to block the recoding of stimulus items into larger chunks, (3) in performance discontinuities caused by the capacity limit, and (4) in various indirect effects of the capacity limit. Under these conditions, rehearsal and long-term memory cannot be used to combine stimulus items into chunks of an unknown size; nor can storage mechanisms that are not capacitylimited, such as sensory memory, allow the capacity-limited storage mechanism to be refilled during recall. A single, central capacity limit averaging about four chunks is implicated along with other, noncapacity-limited sources. The pure STM capacity limit expressed in chunks is distinguished from compound STM limits obtained when the number of separately held chunks is unclear. Reasons why pure capacity estimates fall within a narrow range are discussed and a capacity limit for the focus of attention is proposed.",

The process-based framework of LTWM is shown to be superior to their product theory because it can explain interactions of the expertise effect in \"contrived\" recall under several testing conditions differing in presentation rate, instructions, and memory procedures.",

As long as the demands for superior memory are representative and \"intrinsic\" and reflect \"a definite feature of that domain of expertise,\" Vicente and Wang "

As an example, we consider a variant of the ''Knight problem,'' which asks generally what configurations of knights can one place on an n \u060b n chess board such that no knight is attacking any other knight on the board. Using specific ribonuclease digestion to manipulate strands of a 10-bit binary RNA library, we developed a molecular algorithm and applied it to a 3 \u060b 3 chessboard as a 9-bit instance of this problem. Here, the nine spaces on the board correspond to nine ''bits'' or placeholders in a combinatorial RNA library. We recovered a set of ''winning'' molecules that describe solutions to this problem."

This approach, we believe, allows both, researchers in game playing to find appropriate learning techniques for helping to solve their problems as well as machine learning researchers to identify rewarding topics for further research in game-playing domains. The paper covers learning techniques that range from neural networks to decision tree learning in games that range from poker to chess. However, space constraints prevent us from giving detailed introductions to the used learning techniques or games.

The principal author 1 was counseling a 17-yearold boy of Russian/Armenian descent using traditional talk therapy. An exploration of the boy's family relationships revealed his perception of his mother and father as controlling and domineering-\"they're from the Old World,\" as he described it. His heritage led to a discussion of Kasparov and other chess masters he could idealize (he took pride in his cultural identification). Sharing an interest in chess led to a \"challenge\" match, which was observed by the boy's fellow alternative education students. Chess became an immediate catalyst to students seeking a relationship with me, and the use of the game served as a method and metaphor for working with the narcissistic issues affecting their interpersonal and school relationships.",

         "Abstract": "Human game players rely heavily on the experience gained by playing over the games of masters. A player may recall a previous game to either obtain the best move (if he has previously seen the identical position) or suggest a best move (if similar to others seen). However, game-playing programs operate in isolation, relying on the combination of search and programmed knowledge to discover the best move, even in positions well-known to humans. At best, programs have only a limited amount of information about previous games. This paper discusses enhancing a chess-playing program to discover and extract implicit knowledge from previously played grandmaster games, and using it to improve the chess program's performance. During a game, a database of positions is queried looking for identical or similar positions to those on the board. Similarity measures are determined by chunking the position and using these patterns as indices into the database. Relevant information is subsequently passed back to the chess program and used in its decision making process. As the number of games in the database increases, the \"experience\" available to the program improves the likelihood that relevant, useful information can be found for a given position.",
         "Introduction": "For many subject areas requiring skills, a large body of previous experience is usually gathered which can be used as a resource to be studied for improving one's performance. Unfortunately, most attempts at having machines mimic human behavior are primarily concerned with trying to solve the problem in isolation (usually a difficult enough task), without exploiting the available wealth of others' experience. For many disciplines, this information is not available in machine readable form. Other than using simple memory tables, few programs attempt to take advantage of the acquired wealth of human experience on a particular subject."

It is shown that the template theory outperforms its rivals in accounting for the empirical evidence. The theory, which unifies low-level aspects of cognition, such as chunks, with high-level aspects, such as schematic knowledge and planning, suggests that chunks are accessed through a discrimination net, and that they can evolve into more complex data structures (templates) specific to classes of positions.",

The template theory presented by Gobet and Simon based on the EPAM theory offers precise predictions on cognitive processes during the presentation and recall of chess positions. This article describes the behavior of CHREST, a computer implementation of the template theory, in a memory task when the presentation time is varied from one second to sixty, on the recall of game and random positions, and compares the model to human data. Strong players are better than weak players in both types of positions, especially with long presentation times, but even after brief presentations. CHREST predicts the data, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Strong players' superiority with random positions is explained by the large number of chunks they hold in LTM. Their excellent recall with short presentation times is explained by templates, a special class of chunks. CHREST is compared to other theories of chess skill, which either cannot account for the superiority of Masters in random positions or predict too strong a performance of Masters in such positions.",

By looking at extreme performance, cognitive scientists determine what parameters of the human information processing system can change with extensive practice, what parameters are relatively stable, and what strategies can be used to overcome the limits imposed by these stable parameters.

It uses a neural network to learn a relation between the control of the squares and the influence of a move. Depending on what squares a player controls, the chessmaps heuristic tries to determine where the important areas of the chessboard are. Moves that influence these important areas are then ordered first. The heuristic has been incorporated into a move-ordering algorithm that also takes account of immediate tactical threats. Human players also rely strongly on patterns when selecting moves, but would also consider immediate tactical threats, so this move-ordering algorithm is an attempt to mimic something of the human thought process when selecting a move. This paper presents a new definition for the influence of a move, which improves the performance of the heuristic. It also presents a new experience-based approach to determining what areas of the chessboard are important, which may actually be preferred to the chessmaps heuristic. The results from game-tree searches suggest that the move-ordering algorithm could compete with the current best alternative of using the history heuristic with capture moves in a brute-force search.",

At the heart of this is a heuristic called the chessmaps heuristic, that orders moves depending on which areas of the chessboard they influence. The definition for the influence of a move is given in Section 2.3.  If a chessboard is divided into specific areas, which could be of any size or shape, then the term sector is used to define one of these areas and Figs. "

         "Abstract": "Superstars are not by accident a conspicuous phenomenon in our culture, but inherently belong to a meritocratic society with mass media, free enterprise, and competition. To make this contention plausible I will use Caillois's book, Man, Play and Games, 1 to compare the mechanisms underlying the superstar phenomenon with a special kind of game, as set out by Caillois. As far as I know, Caillois's book is not quoted in the literature dealing with income distribution theories, although the comparison with play and games is, for limited purposes, interesting. In play and games we find almost all elements which play a role in theories of just income distribution: equality of opportunity, chance, talent, competition and skill, reward, entitlement, winners and losers, etc. These are not chance similarities, for \". . . games are largely dependent upon the cultures in which they are practised. They affect their preferences, prolong their customs, and reflect their beliefs . . . One . . . can . . . posit a truly reciprocal relationship between a society and the games it likes to play\". 2 Moreover, as we will see, superstars combine the four basic characteristics of play that make their activities a special kind of play.",
         "Introduction": "reality (i.e. money) in play brings along the possibility of the corruption of play (like bribery, drugs, etc.), but the game itself remains intact: \"The nature of competition or the performance is hardly modified if the athletes or comedians are professionals who play for money rather than amateurs who play for pleasure. The difference concerns only the players\". "

         "Abstract": "Pocket computers are beginning to emerge that provide sufficient processing capability and memory capacity to run traditional desktop applications and operating systems on them. The increasing demand placed on these systems by software is competing against the continuing trend in the design of low-power microprocessors towards increasing the amount of computation per unit of energy. Consequently, in spite of advances in low-power circuit design, the microprocessor is likely to continue to account for a significant portion of the overall power consumption of pocket computers. This paper investigates clock scaling algorithms on the Itsy, an experimental pocket computer that runs a complete, functional multitasking operating system (a version of Linux 2.0.30). We implemented a number of clock scaling algorithms that are used to adjust the processor speed to reduce the power used by the processor. After testing these algorithms, we conclude that currently proposed algorithms consistently fail to achieve their goal of saving power while not causing user applications to change their interactive behavior.",
         "Introduction": "Dynamic clock frequency scaling and voltage scaling are two mechanisms that can reduce the power consumed by a computer. Both voltage scaling and frequency scaling are important; the power consumed by a component implemented in CMOS varies linearly with frequency and quadratically with voltage."

         "Abstract": "The fact that the strong side cannot enforce a win in KNNK makes many chess players (both humans and computers) prematurely regard KNNKB and KNNKN to be trivially drawn too. This is not true, however, because there are several tricky mate themes in KNNKB and KNNKN which occur more frequently and require more complicated handling than common wisdom thinks. The text analyzes the mate themes and derives rules from them which allow for the static recognition of potential wins in KNNKB and KNNKN without further lookahead by search. Although endgame databases achieve the same goal, they are normally far less efficient at doing so because of their additional I/O and memory requirements (even when compressed).",
         "Introduction": "Usually, two bare Knights are not much of a force when it comes to mating in late endgames such as KNNK, KNNKB, and KNNKN. It is well-known that these endgames are generally drawn despite the substantial material advantage enjoyed by the strong side "

         "Abstract": "In this paper we explore how deception can be used by rational players in the context of non-cooperative stochastic games with partial information. We show that, when one of the players can manipulate the information available to its opponents, deception can be used to increase the player's payoff by effectively rendering the information available to its opponent useless. However, this is not always the case. Paradoxically, when the degree of possible manipulation is high, deception becomes useless against an intelligent opponent since it will simply ignore the information that has potentially been manipulated. This study is carried out for a prototype problem that arises in the control of military operations, but the ideas presented are useful in other areas of applications, such as price negotiation, multi-object auctioning, pursuit-evasion, etc.",
         "Introduction": "Competitive games are usually classified as either having full or partial information. In full-information games both players know the whole state of the game when they have to make decisions. By state, we mean all information that is needed to completely describe the future evolution of the game, when the decision rules used by both players are known. Examples of full information games include Chess, Checkers, and Go. Partial-information games differ from these in that at least one of the players does not know the whole state of the game. Poker, Bridge, and Hearts are examples of such games. In full information games, as a player is planning its next move, it only needs to hypothesize over its and the opponent's future moves to predict the possible outcomes of the game "

This page describes a little package I wrote which lets you display chess games and diagrams in maple. This was motivated by a desire to have a program which prints diagrams in linux (and also as an excuse to do some fun programming:). It does not play chess, though I hope it one day to at least be able to play some endgames."

The amount of \"computation\" carried out by human players is smaller by orders of magnitudes because they employ specific patterns that help them narrow the search tree. Similar approach should in principle be feasible also in computer programs. To draw attenion to this issue, we report our experiments with a program that learns to classify chessboard positions that permit the well-known bishop sacrifice at h7. We discuss some problems pertaining to the collection of training examples, their representation, and pre-classification. Classification accuracies achieved with a decision-tree based classifier are encouraging.",

         "Introduction": "Object manipulation is an important class of motions for interactive animated characters. Manipulation tasks can encompass a virtually unlimited combination of object and obstacle geometries. Thus, it seems unlikely that one would be able to successfully enumerate all possibilities and simply store thousands of pre-recorded motion sequences. Instead, a flexible strategy that can accommodate a wide range of situations is needed."

The absolute level of uncertainty about the situation in the battlespace is seen as unimportant. Is that true? Results obtained with a dynamic, chessbased wargame indicate that the answer to this question is no -the absolute level of uncertainty is important. More specifically the results show that as the absolute level of uncertainty increases, the value of having information superiority as well as the value of having superior strength decreases, whereas the value of having tempo superiority remains unaffected. Two conclusions are drawn. The first is that information superiority may be best created at lower levels of command where uncertainty is at its lowest. The second is that because uncertainty probably will continue to be a problem in war, tempo superiority may be a more viable alternative than information superiority or superior strength for winning.",

Players also evaluate the affect each move will have on the balance of power in the game. Novice players often fail to detect threatened pieces of either color. They also find prediction difficult and frequently neglect to think ahead about the negative ramifications of their moves. We have developed a chess visualization tool that helps novice players track the relative risk in which either their pieces or their opponent\u00d5s pieces reside. The visualization tool also enables novice players to maintain a sense of the amount of influence each side has over empty squares. Advanced players may also find value in the chess visualization tool in evaluating and identifying the critical decisions made in grandmasters\u00d5 games.",

What makes expert chess players exceptionally good is that they can compare and evaluate these potential outcomes to one another and choose the current move that will benefit them the most. Chess masters can easily evaluate board situations at a glace and begin concentrating on their future strategies."

The greatest success of game tree search so far, has been the victory of the chess machine 'Deep Blue' vs. G. Kasparov, the best human chess player in the world. When a game tree is too large to be examined exhaustively, the standard method for computers to play games is as follows. A partial game tree (envelope) is chosen for examination. This partial game tree may be any subtree of the complete game tree, rooted at the starting position. It is explored by the help of the \u03b1\u03b2-algorithm, or any of its variants. All \u03b1\u03b2variants have in common that a single faulty leaf evaluation may cause a wrong decision at the root. To overcome this insecurity, we propose Cc2s, a new algorithm, which selects an envelope in a way that the decision at the root is stable against a single faulty evaluation. At the same time, it examines this envelope efficiently. We describe the algorithm and analyze its time behavior and correctness. Moreover, we are presenting some experimental results from the domain of chess. Cc2s is used in the parallel chess program P.ConNerS, which won the",
         "Introduction": "Some games have been proven to be PSPACE-complete. As a consequence, we cannot do anything better than to examine a complete game tree when we want to find a perfect decision or if we want to know the value of the starting situation. For most of the interesting board games we do not know the correct values of all positions. Therefore, we are forced to base our decisions on heuristic or vague knowledge. An approximation is done by the following method."

Michael Buro presented in his paper \"From Simple Features to Sophisticated Evaluation Functions\" a practical framework for the semi-automatic construction of evaluation functions for games. According to his approach, only some simple domain specific features are hand coded. Complex rules become automatically derived from the simple features and are combined in a linear evaluation model. Each rule has a weight that will be fitted automatically according to a large set of classified game positions. This approach was very successful in the domain of Othello. The aim of the work presented here is therefore to investigate, whether this evaluation function generator can also be used for the domain of computer chess. The following text contains some helpful hints for an efficient implementation of such an evaluation function generator for chess and also the necessary mathematical formulas needed for the weight fitting algorithm."

However, the large search spaces normally occurring robotics and expensive training experiences required by reinforcement learning algorithms has hampered its applicability. This paper introduces a new approach for reinforcement learning based on a relational representation which: (i) can be applied over large search spaces, (ii) can incorporate domain knowledge, and (iii) can use previously learned policies on different, although similar, problems. In the proposed framework states are represented as sets of first order relations, actions in terms of those relations, and policies are learned over such generalized representation. It is shown how this representation can capture large search spaces with a relatively small set of actions and states, and that policies learned over this generalized representation can be directly apply to other problems which can be characterized by the same set of relations.",

         "Abstract": "We recently proposed Uncertainty Paradigm Search (UPS), a novel deterministic approach for solving problems with uncertainty. One of its applications is in Tsuitate-Tsume-Shogi (mating problems in a Kriegspiel-like variant of Shogi). This approach relies on the use of metapositions. A metaposition is a hybrid complex of possible positions that are not distinguishable for the solver. In this contribution, we examine four methods for encoding a metaposition into some value with fewer bits in order to use a transposition table. Each encoding method is tested in a search process, using a benchmark test set of 102 problems. They show us that the efficiency of search by using a transposition table is improved by a factor of eight. The four encoding methods make use of (1) arithmetic sum, (2) exclusive-OR sum, (3) two cyclic redundancy check codes, and (4) a secure hash function. The method of exclusive-OR sum proves not to be acceptably resistant to type-1 errors in this domain; the others are. Though the execution time is roughly comparable among the other three methods, the arithmetic sum is slightly superior in our implementation.",
         "Introduction": "Game-tree search has been the most important part in developing computer programs to play games with perfect information. Each node and edge in a game tree represents a position and a move respectively. When programming a game with imperfect information, a node of a game tree represents a position, too. However, here we have the difficulty of representing uncertainty. Seen from a game-player's point of view, we would like to know precisely which positions are represented by that node and which are not. To deal with this problem we use information sets arising from the uncertainty that characterizes nodes in the search. Recently, we proposed a novel deterministic approach for solving problems with uncertainty, called Uncertainty Paradigm Search (UPS) "

         "Abstract": "We have recently proposed a novel paradigm for solving problems with uncertainty, called Uncertainty Paradigm. Under this paradigm, solving such a problem deterministically is resolved into the plain AND/OR tree search, which we call Uncertainty Paradigm Search. It uses a metaposition as a node of a game tree instead of a position and a metamove instead of a move. We have shown the applicability and justifiability of this paradigm to both a singleagent problem and an adversary-agent problem. The previous implementation of the search under this paradigm was based on a simple depth-first full-width search with iterative deepening, which did not use a transposition table. In this contribution, we have examined several methods for encoding a metaposition into some value with fewer bits. Then, a transposition table using these encoding methods is incorporated into the search. To confirm the effectiveness of the use of a transposition table, we have chosen the domain of Tsuitate-Tsume-Shogi (mating problems of Kriegspiel-like variant of Shogi). The experiments performed with a test set show us that the efficiency of search with a transposition table is turned out to be higher than the case without it at most by a factor of fourteen. As for encoding methods of a metaposition, we have confirmed that the method that simply sums up each code of position in the metaposition is efficient and allowedly collision-resistant in this domain.",

A search under this paradigm is denoted as Uncertainty-Paradigm Search (UPS). UPS is a new forward calculation method of true solutions for dynamic games. In UPS, a metaposition instead of a normal position is employed as a node of a game tree as well as a metamove instead of a normal move. A metaposition is a hybrid of possible positions, while a metamove i s a hybrid of possible moves that is used as an arc between a metaposition and its metaposition successor. Deterministic solving of search problems with uncertainty i s t h us resolved into a plain AND/OR tree search for multi-person games as well as for single-agent puzzles. Theoretically, UPS is applicable in solving any puzzles or endgame problems for incomplete-information games. We implemented UPS in a computer program of a c hess-like game with uncertainty, i.e., Kriegspiel-like v ariant of Japanese chess, and Counterfeit-Coin Problem. We then demonstrated the eectiveness of the proposed idea.",

Pangaea takes the idea of distribution transparency one logical step further: both the decision for an appropriate distribution strategy for a program, and the realization of that strategy on a particular distribution platform, are accomplished not only transparently, but also automatically. An important benefit of using static source code analysis for automatic distribution is that it can detect optimizations which would be impossible for a purely run-time based approach.",
         "Introduction": "Pangaea 1 is a system that can distribute centralized Java programs automatically. Based on static source code analysis, Pangaea first takes an abstract decision how a given program should be distributed, such that certain requirements and optimization criteria are fulfilled. The distribution strategy thus obtained indicates which objects should be placed onto which node, when and how object migration is to be employed, etc. Pangaea then realizes that strategy by transforming the program's source code for a given distribution platform, trying to make good use of the abilities and features of that platform. Pangaea can therefore be considered a distributing compiler: the source language is pure Java, without any restrictions or added constructs, the target language is the distributed Java variant of the chosen distribution platform."

High-performance, scalable, and parallel computing algorithms are crucial in data mining as datasets grow i n e x o rably in size and complexity. Inductive logic is a research area in the intersection of machine learning and logic programming, which has been recently applied to data mining. Inductive logic studies learning from examples, within the framework provided by clausal logic. It provides a uniform and very expressive means of representation: All examples, background knowledge as well as the induced theory are expressed in rst-order logic. However, such an expressive representation is often computationally expensive. This report rst presents the background for p a rallel data mining, the BSP model, and inductive logic programming. Based on the study, t h i s report gives an approach to parallel inductive logic in data mining that solves the potential performance problem. Both parallel algorithm and cost analysis are provided. This approach is applied to a number of problems and it shows a super-linear speedup. To justify this analysis, I implemented a parallel version of a c o re ILP system { Progol { in C with the support of the BSP parallel model. Three test cases are provided and a double speedup phenomenon is observed on all these datasets and on two di erent parallel computers.",

The central hypothesis of this report is that it is necessary and feasible to adopt parallel algorithms in the data mining process. I show that parallelism can be e ciently applied to inductive logic programming (ILP). The powerful knowledge representation and excellent i n tegration with background knowledge of ILP has shown a great value among data-mining algorithms."

Social psychologists, who study theory of mind processes under the rubric of attribution research, have shown that people often make a logical error of inference: The ``fundamental attribution error'' (FAE) is the tendency to assume that an actor's behavior and mental state correspond to a degree that is logically unwarranted by the situation. The social environment in which theory of mind capacities evolved may have influenced attributional processing in ways that could explain the error. In particular, the error could be caused by a psyche that is designed (1) to consider only those noncorresponding mental states (such as deception) that could have fitness consequences to the mind reader; (2) to bias inferences in a way that reduces the costs of erroneous inferences; or (3) to bias inferences in a way that yields reputational benefits. The existing literature is reviewed in light of these hypotheses.",

TD learning is used to adjust the weights for evaluation features over the course of a series of games, starting from arbitrary initial values. For some games, to obtain weights accurate enough for high-performance play will require the TD learning phase to make use of minimax searches. A theoretical description of TD applied to minimax search is given, and we discuss how the theoretical characteristics of the method interact with practical considerations. These include the depth of search appropriate for successful learning and the use of self-play to enable the algorithm to be independent of human knowledge. We then report on experiments that obtained values for use in shogi-playing programs. Unlike chess, shogi has no generally agreed standardized set of values for pieces, so there is more need for machine learning. We compare our machine-learnt values, obtained without any human knowledge input, with hand-crafted values. TD learning was successful in obtaining values that performed well in matches against hand-crafted values.",

Where the Knight had read the fers as a female in need of the protection of the chess king, himself, the poet-audience of his lament, reads the fers more properly as a counsellor (Persian farzan, Latin farcia, French fierce); and, whereas the grieving knight declares he can no longer play the game once his fers is away (665-66), the poet correctly points out that the knight's despair is exaggerated (640-41); for in the game of chess, any pawn can be promoted to a queen. In the course of his inquisition, the poet, playing poun errant, promotes himself, effectively, to a counsellor. ",

Despite these advantages, chess has two significant drawbacks as a general AI testbed: the first is the success of computer chess players that use hard-coded, domain specific rules and strategies to play; and the second is the fact that standard chess is a perfect information domain.

         "Introduction": "Making decisions under uncertainty remains one of the central problems in AI research. An agent in an uncertain world needs to select actions from the action search space -the set of all possible actions in that world. As the uncertainty increases, this task can become increasingly difficult. The number of possible actions may increase, the number of possible situations in which those actions may be applied may increase, or both. The effects of these growing search spaces are amplified as the agent tries to search further ahead. Each action on each possible world state requires more possible world states to be evaluated for future moves. This property of imperfect information domains makes tackling real-world problems extremely difficult."

Examining the spatial distribution of the first five fixations for each position by skill group revealed that experts produced more fixations on empty squares than did intermediates. When fixating pieces, experts produced a greater proportion of fixations on relevant pieces than did intermediates.

         "Introduction": "In order to convey a sense of immersion, a virtual environment (VE) system must not only present a convincing visual rendering of the simulated objects, but also allow to manipulate them in a fast, precise, and natural way. Rather than relying on mouse or keyboard, direct manipulation of virtual objects is enabled by employing tracking with six degrees of freedom (6DOF). Frequently, this is done via handheld props (such as flying mouse or wand) that are fitted with magnetic trackers. However, this technology can only offer limited quality because it is inherently tethered, inaccurate and susceptible to magnetic interference. Early on, optical tracking has been proposed as an alternative. One main reason why optical tracking is so attractive is because unlike tethered magnetic tracking it supports capturing human movement without the need for active sensors, thus allowing interaction without the use of props. In particular, the tracking of hands is relevant, because it allows natural gesturing (Figure "

Although the two types of chess have the same number of pieces, similar individual characteristics for pieces, and comparable scales of the size of the boards, the fundamental differences in their playing rules lead to different construction schemes and results of endgame databases. In this paper, we describe our approach to the construction of Chinese Chess Endgame Databases when only one of the players possesses attacking piece(s). We show the results we have in constructing and analyzing a set of 151 endgame databases with a total of at most two attacking pieces, four defending pieces and two Kings. Our databases can be used by Chinese chess computer playing systems and computer aided Chinese chess training systems.",
         "Introduction": "The study and playing of games and puzzles benefitted from knowledge databases abstracted from them. In Western chess, retrograde analysis has been successfully applied to construct endgame databases. For example, a constrained 6-piece endgame, KRP(a2)KbBP(a3), is constructed using heuristic retrograde analysis [7], and the complete 5-piece databases to solve KPPKP endgame are also available [3]. On the other hand, little is known of Chinese chess endgame databases in comparable scale until recently [9,10]. It is prerequisite to construct them for better endgame studies and improve the Chinese chess playing programs."

         "Abstract": "Neither [rationalism nor constructivism] is adequate to cover all aspects of social reality. But at one critical point they are joined. Both recognise\u00d0 constructivism as a central research project and rationalism as a background condition\u00d0 that human beings operate in a socially constructed environment, which changes over time. Hence, both analytical perspectives focus in one way or another on common knowledge . . .",
         "Introduction": "tension between formal game theory and approaches that emphasise the social construction of reality. The Philosophical Investigations questioned the formulation of abstract formal languages\u00d0 why is our existing language insuf\u00ae cient?\u00d0 and argued the need to return to the ``rough ground'' of everyday language use. In this respect, formal game theory and Wittgensteinian language games appear to represent opposing epistemological positions, which have implications for how research is undertaken. However, it is often the case that traditions de\u00ae ned in opposition to one another have unexpected places of overlap and continuity."

We give a particular focus on the underlying qualities the ICC possesses in order to succeed and grow such as utilization of real-world credibility indicators (titles), a robust economic system, and mechanisms for user-contributed feature extensions. As ICC expands in scope and scale, its segmentation strategies are analyzed as well as the impact of these extensions on its business strategy.",
         "Introduction": "In the early 1990s, there was a public code base for client-server based Internet chess playing. Prospective chess players could telnet into a server machine (which was somewhat nomadic), logon with a self-declared and unique 'handle' or ID, and then challenge one another and begin play. There were severe usability problems in the nascent Internet chess offerings. The first was the lack of a graphical interface. With a text-only screen, users were reduced to representing a chessboard as an ASCII 8x8 grid. The second was an unwanted penalty for players connecting from relatively slower networks than their adversaries. Network delay caused the slower connection speeds to be punished with less thinking times."

         "Abstract": "In paired comparison experiments, the worth or merit of a unit is measured through comparisons against other units. When paired comparison outcomes are collected over time and the merits of the units may be changing, it is often convenient to assume the data follow a non-linear state-space model. Typical paired comparison state-space models that assume a \u00ae xed (unknown) autoregressive variance do not account for the possibility of sudden changes in the merits. This is a particular concern, for example, in modeling cognitive ability in human development; cognitive ability not only changes over time, but also can change abruptly. We explore a particular extension of conventional state-space models for paired comparison data that allows the state variance to vary stochastically. Models of this type have recently been developed and applied to modeling \u00ae nancial data, but can be seen to have applicability in modeling paired comparison data. A \u00ae ltering algorithm is also derived that can be used in place of likelihood-based computations when the number of objects being compared is large. Applications to National Football League game outcomes and chess game outcomes are presented.",
         "Introduction": "Paired comparison data arise when objects are compared to elicit a preference or a degree of preference.

We summarize here the major sources of evidence for chunking mechanisms, and consider how such mechanisms have been implemented in computational models of the learning process. We distinguish two forms of chunking: the first deliberate, under strategic control, and goal-oriented; the second automatic, continuous, and linked to perceptual processes. Recent work with discrimination-network computational models of long-and short-term memory (EPAM/CHREST) has produced a diverse range of applications of perceptual chunking. We focus on recent successes in verbal learning, expert memory, language acquisition and learning multiple representations, to illustrate the implementation and use of chunking mechanisms within contemporary models of human learning.",

A solution to this problem is to explicitly identify a broad range of real-world strategies that people would use if the environment of the interactive entertainment were real rather than fiction, to represent these strategies to identify their component features, and to design the entertainment environment so that these component features are supported and recognized. This paper gives an example of how the first two steps of this solution can be done in the political domain by examining 60 explicit strategies outlined in Machiavelli's The Prince.",

Before the beginning of a game Turk's doors were opened and the audience saw a proliferation of gear wheels inside. Over a few decades it participated in hundreds of exhibitions and won against most of its opponents, including Napoleon. However, on May 1827 Turk's secret was revealed by two boys who observed a small man coming out of Turk. It became thus clear that this was a chessmaster who made his moves from a secret compartment.",

Overall, we executed 24,000 self-play games (3,000 per match) in one \"calibration\" match and seven \"depth X+1 \u21d4 X\" handicap matches at fixed iteration depths ranging from 5-12 plies. For the experiment to be realistic and independently repeatable, we relied on a state-of-the-art commercial contestant: Fritz 6, one of the strongest modern chess programs available. The main result of our new experiment is that it shows the existence of diminishing returns for additional search in computer chess selfplay by Fritz 6 with 95% statistical confidence. The average rating gain per search iteration shrinks by half from 169 ELO at 6 plies to 84 ELO at 12 plies. The diminishing returns manifest themselves by declining rates of won games and reversely increasing rates of drawn games for the deeper searching program versions. Their rates of lost games, however, remain quite steady for the whole depth range of 5-12 plies.",

However, it seems odd that such strategies could influence the success of chess players, because this game is usually considered to be influenced mainly by technical-intellective skills. To examine the influence of cognitiveaffective molds, 53 beginner chess players, ages from 9 to 16 years old, enrolled in sport competitions, were assigned to two groups, high and low success. They responded to the MOLDES and the MEA tests, designed to evaluate individuals' molds. The results show that the more successful players used more realistic, positive, and moderated molds, facing reality, and coping with their failures and emotions appropriately, whereas the less successful players used evasive, imaginative, defensive, and inefficient molds.",

Both of these convey a glimpse of the truth but miss the mark of what chess can really offer us. To isolate chess unto itself deprives it of its deeper link with humanity's development, while shackling it to some program for human improvement undermines its autonomy and freedom of expression as an art. Chess is an art, with its own justification, as well as -being part of the weave of life-is part of the fabric of humanity's development."

The present study looked at several real world indicators for evidence of a rise. First, the prevalence of mild mental retardation in the US population and elsewhere has been steadily declining for decades. Second, players in various intellectual games, particularly chess but to a lesser extent bridge and go, are reaching high performance levels at earlier and earlier ages. There are many more prodigies. Third, scienti\u00aec productivity, measured by number of journal articles and patents awarded, has risen greatly over the last few decades, even though much top intellectual talent may be shifting from science. Finally, I surveyed perceptions of teachers who had taught in high schools for over 20 years. Most reported perceiving that average general intelligence, ability to do school work, and literacy skills of school children had not risen since 1979 but most believed that childrens's practical ability had increased. Most reported perceiving a decline in students's motivation, which may be aecting their perceptions of general intelligence. All these trends have various possible causes other than rising intelligence. However, together, and with other recent empirical evidence, most indicators suggest population intelligence really could be rising.",

The questions posed by Egbert Meissenburg 1 as to the \"Who?\", \"Where?\", \"When?\", \"How\" and \"Why?\" have not yet been conclusively answered despite numerous concerted efforts. One further source which up until recently had been rather underestimated is now becoming increasingly significant: the game itself. This can perfectly well provide additional information on its origins. Thus, five modern representatives will now be briefly and chronologically mentioned who have investigated chess from the viewpoint that the structure of the game and its kinship to other games must be given greater attention than in the past. A forerunner of this new movement was Joseph Needham 2 . He was the first to free chess from its isolated position amongst all games in his 1962 book and suggested that divination could be a common origin of numerous games. He hereby left us a \"family tree\" of old games (cf. Fig. "

Independent of their spatial locations, objects of interest are depicted sharply in SDOF, whereas the context of the visualization is blurred. In this paper, we present a flexible model of SDOF which can be easily adopted to various types of applications. We discuss pros and cons of the new technique, give examples of application, and describe a fast prototype implementation of SDOF.",

The experiments carried out by Beal and Smith, using random minimaxing in Chess, showed that the strength of play increases as the depth of the lookahead is increased. We investigate random minimaxing from a combinatorial point of view in an attempt to gain a better understanding of the utility of the minimax procedure and a theoretical justification for the results of Beal and Smith's experiments. The concept of domination is central to our theory. Intuitively, one move by white dominates another move when choosing the former move would give less choice for black when it is black's turn to move, and subsequently more choice for white when it is white's turn to move. We view domination as a measure of mobility and show that when one move dominates another then its probability of being chosen is higher.",

We report on relevant experiments including a learning experience on the Internet Chess Club (ICC) from which we can estimate a rating for the new program.

         "Abstract": "The present paper argues that generalisation is conservative. Our goal was to experimentally study the links between knowledge generalisation and the storage of contextual elements. The knowledge domain, very simple chess con gurations, allowed subjects, novices in chess, to acquire micro-expertise based on the analysis of a single source problem. In the rst experimental phase, subjects had to analyse a source problem. We induced two modes of source-problem encoding: In the rst group, subjects were given explanations focused on the sequence of elementary solving steps; in the other group they were given the general principle relevant to the category of problems in question. Subjects had then to solve diVerent tests (solving isomorphic problems, recall tests, similarity tests) designed to answer two questions: The rst question was to test whether the experimental manipulation in the two groups had in fact generated knowledge that varied in abstractness; the second question was to determine whether generalisation is accompanied by storage of surface features of the source problem. Results show that the knowledge generalisation is conservative. Subjects who generalise their knowledge have a better memory retention of context-dependent elements than the other subjects.",

We focus mainly on techniques that have not only withstood the test of time but also embody ideas that are still relevant in contemporary game-playing programs. Pseudo code is provided for a special formulation of the PVS/ZWS alpha-beta search algorithm, as well for an implementation of the method of singular extensions. We provide some data from recent experiments with Abyss'99, an updated Chinese Chess program. We also pinpoint the current research in forward pruning, since this is where the greatest performance improvements are possible. The work closes with a short summary of the impact of computer chess work on Chinese Chess, Shogi and Go.",
         "Introduction": "The number of nodes visited by the alpha-beta algorithm grows exponentially with increasing search depth. This obviously limits how search can be used to assess the outcome of a game state. The basic question remains; how can game-playing programs make best use of the available time to find a good move? Although, the basic formulation of the alpha-beta algorithm explores all continuations to the same depth, it has long been evident that this is not the best search strategy. Instead, some continuations should be explored more deeply, while less interesting ones are terminated prematurely. In chess, for example, it is common to resolve forced situations, such as giving check or re-capturing, by searching them more deeply. The search efficiency, and consequently the move-decision quality, of the programs is greatly influenced by the choices of how to vary the search horizon. Therefore, the design of variable-depth search criteria is fundamental to any gameplaying program using an alpha-beta minimax method."

         "Introduction": "The brilliance of Modern Chess can be attributed to its formal simplicity and its substantive complexity. This was a consequence of increasing the mobility of the pieces, without diluting it over a larger board. Modern Chess is played with a small set of pieces on a geometrically simple board, and while its rules can be mastered by children, it quickly becomes mind-bogglingly complex. This makes it as challenging for the grandmaster as it is for the beginner. FIDE's stabilization of the game did not, of course, eliminate all variations or end attempts to \"improve\" it, but thus far, modifications have produced only curiosities (if not monstrosities.) Trivial changes don't seem worth bothering about, and significant changes destroy the virtues of the original game. One is tempted to say that Chess has reached a perfection. In any case, any plausible modification must preserve its two crucial characteristics: formal simplicity and substantive complexity. It is with this in mind, that we have developed Circular Chess."

ChessEdu game histories play an important role from the didactic point of view, since they allow tutors to review what students have done and to guide their work. Annotations to the histories also allow tutors to include links to simplified positions. In this way, students learn chess by working on simple examples related to their previous wrong decisions in their game. ChessEdu is the first step in the definition of a framework to simplify the development of guided collaborative tutoring applications in a much broader context.",

All these high-performance game-playing programs use global search methods, which evaluate complete game positions. Local search is an alternative approach that works well in the case where a game state can be partitioned into independent subgames. The method of decomposition search [M. M uller, in: IJCAI-99, 1999, p. 578] can solve such games by a combination of local combinatorial game search with evaluation techniques from combinatorial game theory. We compare local and global search in endgame problems in the game of Go, which has been traditionally regarded as beyond the range of exact search-based solution methods. An endgame solver based on decomposition search can solve problems with solution lengths exceeding 60 moves.",

Games such as 4-in-a-row, Gomoku or Nine Men's Morris have been solved, and heuristic game-playing programs have reached world championship level in a number of popular games. In chess and checkers, endgame databases constructed using retrograde analysis have uncovered a wealth of new information and forced the rewriting of the textbooks."

         "Introduction": "Sottolineo che questo mio breve lavoro non si prefigge assolutamente di definirsi una \"storia completa dei fantascacchi\", ma piuttosto traccia a grandi linee un tragitto che si accosta ad altri brevi scritti fantascacchistici, apparsi nel corso di molti anni di critica e saggistica. Una rassegna che non pu\u00f2 avere per forza di cose pretese di completezza, ma che dipinge un quadro senz'altro significativo dei pi\u00f9 importanti contributi alla \"fantascienza scacchistica\". Per la stesura di questo articolo mi avvarr\u00f2, in alcune sue parti, della serie di articoli curati dal sottoscritto per la rivista bimestrale di comunicazione scacchista degli Anni Settanta L'Arcimatto, diretta da Maurizio Mascheroni (oggi curatore di uno dei maggiori siti sugli scacchi, www.maskeret.com, e che ringrazio per la realizzazione delle due immagini riportate pi\u00f9 avanti raffiguranti la posizione di gioco di due esempi che cito). Certo, qui il discorso \u00e8 leggermente diverso, visto che il lettore di Delos la fantascienza la vive quotidianamente e pertanto molte delle introduzioni risulterebbero pressoch\u00e9 inutili e scontate. Per questo riutilizzer\u00f2 soltanto i pezzi pi\u00f9 consoni alla trattazione dell'argomento, evitando i tanti interventi introduttivi gi\u00e0 pubblicati. E' evidente, in tutta onest\u00e0, che il gioco degli scacchi non ha un vero debito verso la fantascienza, ma risulta tuttavia vero che spesso il nostro genere letterario preferito \u00e8 stato affascinato da questo gioco non poche volte. Per un giusto approccio credo sia necessario suddividere il discorso in tre parti ben distinte: 1) Romanzi nei quali la trama \u00e8 generalmente imperniata sul gioco degli scacchi 2) Racconti nei quali gli scacchi rappresentano la parte predominante del testo 3) Romanzi e racconti nei quali il nobil gioco svolge un ruolo secondario, in taluni casi minimo, seppur presente e simbolicamente valido."

It will be argued that modern theoretical concepts of attention, imagery and memory are based on underlying concepts of capacity and format and that these concepts are not sufficiently powerful to express all phenomena associated with mental contents. Instead, one must develop a genuinely content-oriented theoretical language to discuss, for example, contents and their integration into thinking. The main problem is how to explain the contents of representations. Why do representations have precisely the contents that they have. Here the main attention will be focussed on the question how can one explain the selection of content elements in representations. To formulate the basic concepts of contentoriented thought research several issues must be discussed. Firstly, it will be shown that traditional attention and memory research is capacity-oriented and therefore unable to express mental contents. Secondly, it will be argued that there are content phenomena which must be explained by properties of other content phenomena. Thirdly, it will be shown that in chess, people integrate information into representations by using functional rules or reasons, i.e. concepts and rules, which tell why some information contents must be included in a representation. It will then be shown that people integrate information around learned 'thought models' whose contents, together with functional rules or reasons, explain and clarify the contentstructure of a mental representation. It will also be argued that the analysis of contents is metascientifically closer to linguistics with its basic method of explication and content analysis than natural sciences, which form the most common underlying model in current experimental psychology. Finally, content-oriented cognitive psychology and its presuppositions will be compared with neural and computational approaches to show that it gives an additional and alternative theoretical resource, but not a contradictory conceptual platform, to the previous theoretical ways of working with human thinking.",

         "Abstract": "This article presents the results of experiments designed to gain insight into the effect of the minimax algorithm on the error of a heuristic evaluation function. Two types of effect of minimax are considered: (a) evaluation accuracy (are the minimax backed-up values more accurate than the heuristic values themselves?), and (b) decision accuracy (are moves played by deeper minimax search better than those by shallower search?). The experiments were performed in the KRK chess endgame and in randomly generated game trees. The results show that, counter-intuitively, evaluation accuracy may decline with search depth, whereas at the same time decision accuracy improves with depth. In the article, this is explained by the fact that minimax in combination with a noisy evaluation function introduces a bias into the backed-up evaluations, which masks the evaluation effectiveness of minimax, but this bias still permits decision accuracy to improve with depth. This observed behaviour of minimax in the KRK endgame is discussed in the light of previous studies of pathology in minimax. It is shown that explaining the behaviour of minimax in an actual chess endgame in terms of previously known results requires special care.",

When the different layers of beliefs are independent of each other, we can retain Hars\u00e1nyi's type-space, and we can define straightforward generalizations of Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (bne) and Rationalizability in our context. Since neither of these concepts is quite satisfactory, we propose a hybrid concept, Mirage Equilibrium, providing us with a practical tool to work with inconsistent belief hierarchies. When the different layers of beliefs are correlated, we must enlarge the type-space to include the parametric beliefs. This presents us with the difficulty of the inherent openness of finite belief subspaces. Appealing to bounded rationality once more, we posit that the players believe that their opponent holds a belief hierarchy one layer shorter than they do and we provide alternative generalizations of bne and Rationalizability. Finally, we show that, when beliefs are degenerate point beliefs, the definition of Mirage Equilibrium coincides with that of the generalized bne.",

These range from bacteria and yeast to bigger organisms such as plants, animals, and humans. One of the main aims of collecting all these data is to study the function of the encoded proteins. The eventual goal of all these studies is to understand how the genetic structure affects and controls biological processes.

This study hypothesized that participants who first trained with such skeletal shapes would perform differently and perhaps better on a post-test, i.e., they would use mental imagery more, plan more and find more parsimonious solutions. Working with partial visual information may help people: a) memorize the shape and then visualize the memorized object, b) cultivate a more patient mind-set for \"spatial planning\", as opposed to an impulsive \"click-first and explore\" mind-set."

In the last decade alone, more than a dozen books have been published that examine how Sun Tzu's 2,500-year-old principles in The Art of War can be applied to modern business strategies and tactics. As Donald G. Krause notes in The Art of War for Executives, \"Warfare is one of the more common events in the history of man. Because of its importance to survival, warfare has been studied carefully. The factors that contribute to success in war are fairly well understood. Fundamentally, success in war, as well as in business, is based on leadership.\" 1 Moreover, leadership drives the values and processes individuals in an organization use to accomplish their aims.

The FPGA is a user-reconfigurable logic device well suited to the development of complex digital circuits. In this application, the FPGA is used to perform hardware move generation with implicit move ordering, a time-consuming operation when performed in software. A simpler inter-square connection protocol reduces the number of wires between chess squares, when compared to the DEEP BLUE design. The design also has the capability of generating checking moves separately, as well as indicating discovered checks: an important feature for good move ordering. Integration to the software's transposition table and killer heuristic is demonstrated as well. The device is mounted on a card and inserted in the host computer where it is used as a coprocessor.",

         "Introduction": "In cylindrical chess, one plays on a regular chessboard with the pieces in their standard positions, but imagines that the left and right edges of the board are identified. So, for example, when a rook travels horizontally off the right-hand edge, it reappears in the same row on the left-hand side of the board. It is easy to make a cylindrical chessboard out of paper, by taping together the left-and right-hand edges. However, to avoid the pieces falling off, the simplest way to play cylindrical chess is to use the regular (flat) chessboard and just remember the edge identification. Like 3-dimensional chess, cylindrical chess is well over 100 years old. According to Pritchard "

This paper will refer primarily to the 1997 version, and comparisons with the 1996 version, which we will call Deep Blue I, will be made where appropriate.

Previous research has suggested that when task-specific information is lacking or cognitive demands are high, reasoners will rely on a confirmation strategy as a heuristic when engaging in hypothesis testing. To investigate this hypothesis a combined think aloud-retrospective method was adopted to examine levels of confirmation at novice and expert levels of chess expertise. Ten chess novices and ten experts were instructed to think aloud while choosing a move in given chess positions. Verbalised move sequences were recorded and called back to the chess player to elicit whether they led to a positive (confirming) outcome or negative (falsifying) outcome. It was predicted that novices who do not typically possess substantial amounts of chess specific knowledge would rely on a confirming strategy as a heuristic to select a move in a game of chess. Chess experts have been found to possess large repositories of chess specific knowledge in long-term memory. Access to such knowledge was predicted to reduce cognitive load when choosing a chess move so that experts confirm to a lesser extent and falsify to a greater extent than novices when selecting chess moves. Significant evidence was found to support the use of a confirmation strategy by novices when choosing a move. Experts where found to falsify to a greater extent than confirm when compared to novices as predicted.",

Instrumental music does not satisfy this definition; usually it is not about anything humanly important, and when it is, it can convey no more than banalities. Like others, I argue against the propositional character of Kivy's 'aboutness' criterion; profundity can be revealed or displayed other than via statements and descriptions. I am less inclined than some of Kivy's critics to argue that music conveys profound insights into the emotions or abstract metaphysical ideas, such as unity and identity. Instead, I draw a parallel with great chess, which illustrates the fecundity, flexibility, insight, vitality, subtlety, complexity, and analytical far-reachingness of which the human mind is capable. That demonstration is of deep significance, given the wider importance of an appreciation of our intellectual and imaginative powers, even if chess says nothing about the skills to which it draws attention. My thesis is that some instrumental music is profound in a similar way; namely, for what it exemplifies and thereby reveals about the capacities of the human mind.",

Each vertex assumes a weight w \u2208 {0, 1}. A move consists of selecting a vertex u with w(u) = 1 and firing it, i.e., complementing its weight and that of a selected neighborhood of u. The player first making all weights 0 wins, and the opponent loses. If there is no last move, the outcome is a draw. The main part of the paper consists of constructing a strategy. The 3-fold motivation for exploring these games stems from complexity considerations in combinatorial game theory, extending the hitherto \u2264 1-player cellular automata games to twoplayer games, and the theory of linear error correcting codes.",
         "Introduction": "Cellular Automata Games have traditionally been 0-player games such as Conway's Life, or solitaire games played on a grid or digraph G = (V, E). (This includes undirected graphs, since every undirected edge {u, v} can be interpreted as the pair of directed edges (u, v) and (v, u).) Each cell or vertex of the graph can assume a finite number of possible states. The set of all states is the alphabet. We restrict attention to the binary alphabet {0, 1}. A position is an assignment of states to all the vertices. There is a local transition rule from one position to another: pick a vertex u and fire it, i.e., complement it together with its neighborhood F (u) = {v \u2208 V : (u, v) \u2208 E}. The aim is to move from a given position (such as all 1s) to a target position (such as all 0s). In many of these games any order of the moves produces the same result, so the outcome depends on the set of moves, not on the sequence of moves. Two commercial manifestations are Lights Out manufactured by Tiger Electronics, and Merlin Magic Square by Parker Brothers (but Arthur-Merlin games are something else again). Quite a bit is known about such solitaire games. Background and theory can be found e.g., in "

         "Abstract": "Roughly speaking, the family of combinatorial games consists of two-player games with perfect information (no hidden information as in some card games), no chance moves (no dice) and outcome restricted to (lose, win), (tie, tie) and (draw, draw) for the two players who move alternately. Tie is an end position such as in tic-tac-toe, where no player wins, whereas draw is a dynamic tie: any position from which a player has a nonlosing move, but cannot force a win. Both the easy game of Nim and the seemingly difficult chess are examples of combinatorial games. And so is Go. The shorter terminology game, games is used below to designate combinatorial games.",
         "Introduction": "Amusing oneself with games may sound like a frivolous occupation. But the fact is that the bulk of interesting and natural mathematical problems that are hardest in complexity classes beyond NP , such as Pspace, Exptime and Expspace, are two-player games; occasionally even one-player games (puzzles) or even zero-player games "

A qualitative methodological approach was used, utilising semi-structured and informal individual and group discussions, in conjunction with observations of the chess club 'in action'. The 18 girls who participated in the study ranged in age from 7 to 12 years. The study was interpreted from a feminist perspective, which maintains a concern regarding the ways that schooling, in this arguably enlightened age of gender awareness, continues to transmit and reinforce inequalities between the sexes, albeit in more subtle and less overt forms than in the past.",
         "Introduction": "This article is an account of my attempt to establish a chess club in a coeducational primary school. I write to provide a snapshot of the process, and to explain how I sought to redress any gender imbalance resulting from my initiative. The girls themselves, with their stories and explanations, guided my understanding. Throughout the account, I weave in my evolving awareness of the complex, multilayered scenario of gender bias resulting from the founding of the mixed chess club, the domination and eventual takeover by the boys of the club, and the subsequent establishment of single-sex clubs. I write from the perspective of a practising teacher, although my work eventually led to the incorporation of theoretical insights gained by a return to formal study."

We discuss how increased social capital provides broad classes of benefits to the participants of the network and suggest how volunteerism can be expected to increase the social capital of a network. We present survey data collected from 62 members of ICC to examine how different types of online volunteers are recruited and work in a successful virtual community. We show that ICC volunteers encourage and enable intense interaction for the benefit of all the membership subgroups. That is, volunteers create social capital and serve as a key asset of the ICC business model; they strengthen both the ICC core business tenets and improve the software features it can offer to members, thereby providing the key to one virtual community's business success",

Over the course of 15 sessions, two subjects who knew virtually nothing about the game of chess were trained to memorise positions. Increase in recall performance and chunk size was captured by power functions, confirming predictions made by the template theory [Cogn. Psychol. 31 (1996)  1; Memory 6 (1998) 225; Cogn. Sci. 24 (2000)  651]. The human data were compared to that of a computer simulation run on CHREST (Chunk Hierarchy and REtrieval STructures), an implementation of the template theory. The model accounts for the pattern of results in the human data, although it underestimates the size of the largest chunks and the rate of learning. Evidence for the presence of templates in human subjects was found.",

When playing board games like chess etc., computers use game tree search algorithms to evaluate a position. In this paper, we present a procedure that we call Parallel Controlled Conspiracy Number Search (Parallel CCNS). Briefly, we describe the principles of the sequential CCNS algorithm, which bases its approximation results on irregular subtrees of the entire game tree. We have parallelized CCNS and implemented it in our chess program P.ConNerS, which now is the first in the world that could win a highly ranked Grandmaster chess-tournament. We add experiments that show a speedup of about 50 on 159 processors running on an SCI workstation cluster.",

         "Abstract": "Game tree search deals with the problems that arise, when computers play two-person-zero-sum-games such as chess, checkers, othello etc. The greatest success of game tree search so far, was the victory of the chess machine 'Deep Blue' vs. G. Kasparov[14], the best human chess player in the world at that time. In spite of the enormous popularity of computer chess and in spite of the successes of game tree search in game playing programs, we do not know much about a useful theoretical background that could explain the usefulness of (selective) search in adversary games. We introduce a combinatorial model, which allows us to model errors of a heuristic evaluation function, with the help of coin tosses. As a result, we can show that searching in a game tree will be 'useful' if, and only if, there are at least two leaf-disjoint strategies which prove the root value. In addition, we show that the number of leaf-disjoint strategies, contained in a game tree, determines the order of the quality of a heuristic minimax value. The model is integrated into the context of average-case analyses.",

         "Abstract": "The end of play in combinatorial games is determined by the normal termination rule: A player unable to move loses. We examine combinatorial games that contain global threats. In sums of such games, a move in a component game can lead to an immediate overall win in the sum of all component games. We show how to model global threats in Combinatorial Game Theory with the help of infinite loopy games. Further, we present an algorithm that avoids computing with infinite game values by cutting off branches of the game tree that lead to global wins. We apply this algorithm to combinatorial chess endgames as introduced by Elkies [4]   where this approach allows to deal with positions that contain entailing moves such as captures and threats to capture. As a result, we present a calculator that computes combinatorial values of certain pawn positions which allow the application of Combinatorial Game Theory.",
         "Introduction": "Combinatorial game theory (CGT) applies the divide and conquer paradigm to game analysis and game tree search. We decompose a game into independent components (local games) and compute its value as the sum of all local games. The end of play in a sum of combinatorial games is determined by the normal termination rule: A player unable to move loses. Thus, in a sum of games, no single move or game can be decisive by itself. We investigate a class of games where a move in a local game may lead to an overall win in the sum of all local games. We call such a move globally winning."

However, the content of these chunks is a matter for debate. According to one view, (1) the closer two pieces are to each other on a board (proximity), the more likely they are to be in the same chunk, and (2) skilled players encode the precise locations of pieces. An alternative view is that what information is encoded in a chess chunk is determined more by processing of the attack/defense relations during evaluation. In three experiments, participants evaluated positions and completed recognition tests. Experiment 1 supported the view that expert players make more use of attack/defense relations than of locations of pieces in a recognition test. Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated that, for both long and short presentation times, expert players' recognition for a piece within a position was primed more by a piece related by attack or defense than by a piece merely proximal. These findings challenge theories of expertise for chess that assume a primary role for proximity and location in determining which pieces are grouped together in memory.",

We introduce a combination of the gaze contingent window paradigm and the 'change blindness' flicker paradigm, and document dramatically larger visual spans for experts while processing structured, but not random, chess positions. In addition, in a check detection task, a minimized 3x3 chessboard containing a King and potentially checking pieces was displayed. In this task, experts made fewer fixations per trial, and had a greater proportion of fixations between individual pieces, rather than on pieces.

The scheme results in less synchronization overhead, less processor idle time, and less redundant search effort. Measurements on a 128-processor parallel machine show that the scheme achieves close-to-linear speedups; for large problems the speedups are even superlinear due to better memory usage. On the same machine, the algorithm is 1.6 to 12.9 times faster than traditional work-stealing-based schemes.",

The effective strategies for the attack or the placement of ships have been investigated without considering opponent models. As to the attacking strategies, a strategy, which is based on the checkerboard strategy and selects a square such that the number of possible placements is minimized when the attack is assumed to be missed, has shown the most excellent results. The accuracy of the attacking strategy has turned out to get better as the enumeration of possible placements is performed earlier. Considering the time limitation of experiments, we have selected the attacking strategy that starts the enumeration when the number of remaining ships is less than or equal to 4 and the number of unidentified squares is less than or equal to 70. The examinations of some placing strategies, with the above attacking strategy fixed, have shown a placing strategy that places ships along the edges is superior. In addition, the above placing strategy with prohibiting the connected placements of ships has shown the most excellent results.",

First is the idea that the structure of ancient chess, formed by the various movements of its playing-pieces, must be deeply understood and compared to other contemporaneous games. Second is the idea that we must also understand the deep structure of these other games just as well, if we are to grasp the connections between them.

Although it is not yet obvious whether the best chess program (DEEP BLUE) is in fact a better player than the human World Champion, in many people's mind this is of no relevance; Kasparov lost and a 50-year quest has come to an end.

Randomization both fixes a defect in the original algorithm and introduces significant parallelism. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that the algorithm is efficient (in terms of the number of search-tree vertices that it visits) and highly parallel. On incremental random game trees the algorithm outperforms Alpha-Beta, and speeds up by up to a factor of 18 (using 35 processors). In comparison, Jamboree [ICCA J. 18 (1) (1995) 3-19] speeds up by only a factor of 6. The algorithm outperforms Alpha-Beta in the game of Othello. We have also evaluated the algorithm in a Chess-playing program using the board-evaluation code from an existing Alpha-Beta-based program (Crafty). On a single processor our program is slower than Crafty by about a factor of 7, but with multiple processors it outperforms it: with 64 processors our program is always faster, usually by a factor of 5, sometimes much more.",

Blockage positions, in which neither side can penetrate into the opponent's camp, are a prominent example of such positions. Deep search cannot detect the existence of a blockage, since its judgment is based solely on static evaluation, without taking the goals into consideration. In this paper we introduce a blockage detection method, which manages to detect a large set of blockage positions in pawn endgames, with practically no additional overhead. By examining different aspects of the pawn structure, it checks whether the pawns form a blockage which prevents the king from penetrating into the opponent's camp. It then checks several criteria to find out whether the blockage is permanent.",

In this article we propose a new game-tree search algorithm that uses the realization probabilities of nodes for deciding upon the range of the search. The realization probability of a node represents the probability that the moves leading to the node will actually be played. Our algorithm expands nodes as long as the realization probability of a node is greater than the threshold. Therefore, it spends little computational resource on unrealistic moves, resulting in a more effective search. We have implemented this algorithm in a Shogi-playing program. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on a standard test suite for computer Shogi. Moreover, its performance gain is equivalent to a speed-up of more than two.",
         "Introduction": "Shogi is a chess-like game, which is very popular in Japan. In the context of game-tree searching, the biggest difference between chess and Shogi is the reuse of pieces. In Shogi, once you have captured an opponent's piece, you can reuse the piece by dropping it on any empty square in any subsequent turn. This rule makes the branching factor of Shogi considerably larger than that of chess, especially in endgames where players usually have a large amount of pieces in hand. Today, the majority of strong Shogi programs use many forwardpruning techniques "

However, we found no evidence for a correlation between chess skill and visual memory ability in a group of adult chess players (N = 36, age = 28.4 years). This nding, together with other data in the literature, suggests that there is surprisingly little evidence that chess skill and visuospatial ability are associated in adults. Thus, visual memory ability, and perhaps visuospatial intelligence, may be relatively unimportant factors in the long-term acquisition of chess skill.",

Positions are conceived of as loci, in which allelic moves compete, and the whole theory of openings is regarded as a tree-shaped hyper-memome, of which the memomes of games are branches. Several evolutionary processes of openings and their variations are discussed: frequency-dependent mechanisms, psychological niche occupation, co-evolutionary arms races, and the onset of high quality structures through the Darwinian process.",

The results are summarized and some predictions for the near future are given. The aim of the article is to determine which game characteristics are predominant when the solution of a game is the main target. First, it is concluded that decision complexity is more important than state-space complexity as a determining factor. Second, we conclude that there is a trade-off between knowledge-based methods and brute-force methods. It is shown that knowledge-based methods are more appropriate for solving games with a low decision complexity, while brute-force methods are more appropriate for solving games with a low state-space complexity. Third, we found that there is a clear correlation between the first-player's initiative and the necessary effort to solve a game. In particular, threat-space-based search methods are sometimes able to exploit the initiative to prove a win. Finally, the most important results of the research involved, the development of new intelligent search methods, are described.",

The validity of these tasks was established using external criteria based on the Elo chess rating system. Results from a representative sample of active chess players (N = 259) showed that the ACT is a very reliable test for chess expertise, and that ACT has high predictive validity (r \u2248 .8). Several hypotheses about the relations between chess expertise, chess knowledge, and memory were tested.

A severe drawback in human centric electronic interaction is the fuzziness of the image that the co-operation partners have of each other (i.e. their respective \"identities\") -especially in different and varying application contexts. This uncertainty adversely affects increasingly important \"soft\" co-operation factors like, e.g., trust and social behavior, and should therefore be minimized whenever possible. In addition, the lack of a homogenous representation of digital identities results, even at the systemlevel, in many cases in increased and unnecessary administration tasks -like, e.g., keeping track on user-ids and passwords or typing the same information several times. This makes communication inefficient and error-prone and may introduce various privacy threats. On the other hand, neither the minimal identity representation which is already used at the system's level (e.g. a user-id used for security reasons), nor the emerging proprietary efforts for identifying users uniquely at the application level (e.g. for \"single sign on\" purposes) suffice for comprising the user's identity fully as needed for co-operation of individual human beings.",

It is important to note that personal communication is a major factor for Internet growth."

The method can also be used for other sports. It is specifically designed to handle cases where the number of games played in a season varies greatly between players, and thus the confidence that one can have in an assigned rating also varies greatly between players. In addition, the method is designed to handle situations in which some games in the tournament are played as individuals ('singles'), while others are played with a partner ('pairs'). These factors make application of some statistical treatments, such as the Elo rating system used in chess, difficult to apply. The new method characterizes each player's ability by a numerical rating together with an associated uncertainty in that player's rating. After each tournament, a 'tournament rating' is calculated for each player based on how many points the player achieved and the relative strength of partner(s) and opponent(s). Statistical analysis is then used to estimate the likely error in the calculated tournament rating. Both the tournament rating and its estimated error are used in the calculation of new ratings. The method has been applied to calculate tiddlywinks world ratings based on over 13 000 national tournament games in Britain and the USA going back to 1985.",
         "Introduction": "Sports ratings systems have long been of interest to both sports fans and to statisticians. The sports fan often asks questions such as 'who is the best player in the world at the moment?', 'which player has improved most in the last year?', and 'is this player as good as another who played in a different historical era?'. Ratings system can, in principle, answer these questions on an objective basis. However, the answers will only be as good as the underlying ratings system, which is where the statistician comes in."

Larger problems, however, frequently make a complete search intractable due to space and/or time limitations. In particular, a path-planning agent in a realtime strategy game may need to take an action before its complete search has the time to finish. In such cases, incomplete search techniques (such as RTA*, SRTA*, RTDP, DTA*) can be used. Such algorithms conduct a limited ply lookahead and then evaluate the states envisioned using a heuristic function. The action selected on the basis of such evaluations can be suboptimal due to the incompleteness of search and inaccuracies in the heuristic. It is usually believed that deeper lookahead increases the chances of taking the optimal action. In this paper, we demonstrate that this is not necessarily the case, even when admissible and consistent heuristic functions are used.",

         "Abstract": "Board games, like animal species or human languages, can become extinct. Examples of board games which have disappeared and whose origins remain obscure are numerous. Among them, the Chinese game Liubo is one of the most intriguing. This game was played in ancient China, at least as early as the Zhanguo era of the 4 th century BCE and maybe as early as the 7 th century BCE. Liubo is mentioned in the Analects of Confucius, who lived around 500 BCE. Apparently it was very popular during the Han dynasties (207 BCE-220 CE), when the best players were well respected and belonged to an organization. The game later vanished, probably outshone by the Chinese adaptation of Nard (a Backgammon ancestor) coming from India and Persia when the Tang rulers (618-907 CE) reopened the Silk Road. The very last reference dates from the Song time (before 1162 CE), where it was referred to simply as an \"old game.\" Archaeological evidence is not scarce, and there are quite a few literary references. The Gu bo jing (The Book of the Old Stick Game) from the Later Han times (23-220 CE) described the rules. Unfortunately this work is lost, and its content is only known from later references. The original rules are nowhere else described. Especially intriguing is the board, whose pattern is found in other artefacts, such as the famous \"TLV\" mirrors, for example. The board's cultural significance is fairly well explained and understood, but it still resists delivering any clue on how it could have been used for play! Interested readers are invited to refer to the excellent reconstruction in R\u00f6llicke 1 (1999), which I used for support for this article. Many other theories have been advanced to explain what kind of game Liubo was. ",
         "Introduction": "Following on from the fundamental work done by scholars, orientalists, and archaeologists, this article presents merely the viewpoint of a game player. The purpose is simple: game playing. I propose a speculative reconstruction of the rules in the same spirit as those done for the Egyptian and Mesopotamian games of Antiquity. Although the resulting rules are entirely artificial, my hope was that they would lead to some interesting observations. My first step was to make a board and the necessary pieces and sticks. Then, every point of the rules was carefully play tested. Surprisingly, the results delighted my partners and me."

A powerful computer-chess program calculated the number and magnitude of blunders made by the same 23 grandmasters in hundreds of serious games of slow (\"classical\") chess, regular \"rapid\" chess, and rapid \"blindfold\" chess, in which opponents transmit moves without ever seeing the actual position. Rapid chess led to substantially more and larger blunders than classical chess. Perhaps more surprisingly, the frequency and magnitude of blunders did not differ in rapid versus blindfold play, despite the additional memory and visualization load imposed by the latter. We discuss the involvement of various cognitive processes in human problem-solving and expertise, especially with respect to chess. Prior opposing views about the basis of general chess skill have emphasized the dominance of either (a) swift pattern recognition or (b) analyzing ahead, but both seem important and the controversy appears currently unresolvable and perhaps fruitless.",

Both young and old play in the park, in coffee houses, in tournament halls, and recently in the United States, in the classroom. Scholastic chess' increasing success is due in part to the recognition of its cognitive benefits. Shiv Gaglani found that students experience \"a significant increase in pattern recognition, divergent thinking, and logical reasoning\" (qtd. in McCrary Chess News 43), and Dr. Stuart Margulies observed improvement in reading scores (qtd. in Welcome). These results are reinforced when children engage in chess for the simple enjoyment of competition and socialization with their peers (and the satisfaction of winning games against people several times their own age!) Because chess provides these cognitive benefits along with a variety of social ones, I think that it is important to establish chess as part of the early elementary school curriculum.",

The system teaches by presenting side-by-side examples and highlighting their common structural components. This technique assists the process of generalization and reduces mapping by surface features, allowing students to apply their newly gained knowledge to different sets of problems. SEATS also implements adaptive presentation based on a straightforward model of student/user performance. SEATS was evaluated with a recursion tutorial used by 117 students in a 1-hour tutorial session. Results indicate that using adaptation in combination with the structural example-based feature produces an effect on rate and extent of learning significantly greater than when the features are used alone, or when both are absent. The study further points out that future evaluations will have to take students' curiosity into account, since many of them are likely to give at least some incorrect answers on purpose, to test the response of the system. The results indicate that building SEATS with simple adaptive mechanisms is an efficient way of teaching electronically.",
         "Introduction": "Universities teaching large classes, or offshore and external students, need to amend the teaching methodology that was developed for single homogeneous classes delivered in a single location to ensure quality education. With lecturers teaching classes of 150 to 300+ students, many of whom come from different educational, language, and cultural backgrounds, the role of tutorials and laboratory classes with smaller and more observable groups of students is becoming more important. However, because of restructuring and budget cuts, few schools may afford hiring well trained, well educated professional teachers to do this work. Adaptive CAI systems provide individualized instruction using different methods, and taking into account that students learn at different rates. The benefits of individualized instruction are well documented. Students get the opportunity to improve their skills and make progress in a safe and noncompetitive environment, following their own individual pace."

The first type is caused by a player\u00d5s imperfect knowledge of the opponent, the second type arises from lowquality evaluation functions. In this paper, we investigate the desirability of a precondition, called admissibility, that may prevent the second type of risk. We examine the results of two sets of experiments: the first set is taken from the game of LOA, and the second set from the KQKR chess endgame. The LOA experiments show that when admissibility happens to be absent, the OM results are not positive. The chess experiments demonstrate that when an admissible pair of evaluation functions is available, OM search performs better than minimax, provided that there is sufficient room to make errors. Furthermore, we conclude that the expectation \u00d4the better the quality of the prediction of the opponent\u00d5s move, the more successful OM search is\u00d5 is only true if the quality of both evaluation functions is sufficiently high.",

         "Abstract": "In western chess, retrograde analysis has been successfully applied to construct 6-piece endgame databases. This classical algorithm first determines all terminal win or loss positions, i.e., those that are either checkmate or stalemate, and then propagates the values back to their predecessors until no further propagation is possible. The un-propagated positions are then declared draws. However, in Chinese chess, there are special rules other than checkmate and stalemate to end a game. Therefore, some terminal positions cannot be determined by the typical retrograde analysis algorithm. If these special rules are ignored in the construction of the endgame databases, the resulting databases may contain incorrect information. In this paper, we not only describe our approach in abstracting the special rules of Chinese chess and its consequent problems when retrograde analysis is applied, but also give a solution to construct complete endgame databases complying with the most important special rules.",

Tele-collaboration shifts the communications paradigm from presentation to participation, which requires real time projection of the collaborators (and their work spaces or environments) into a shared virtual space where the interaction would take place. An augmented reality system supplements the real world with computer generated objects superimposed on the real world. There is a considerable body of literature "

It still is done in subordination to other purposes, mainly to technical instruction in textbooks, or anecdotal variety in game collections. Very early in his training, alongside with relative value of pieces, the basic mates, and the rest of elementary principles, the chess student learns the general outline of the history of chess: Philidor and the pawns, Anderssen and combination, Steinitz and positional principles, Nimzowitsch and the Hypermoderns, the rise of the Soviet School, . . . . But this 'historical awareness' of every chess player is rather uncritical and not very faithful to the way history really unfolded-just as happens with the casual historical conception of science or art. To be a chess player it is not necessary an acquaintance with the life of Philidor or the circumstances in which his work and discoveries took place, or an understanding of the conditions to which Steinitz reacted-just as a physicist does not need to know the biography of Robert Hook, or as a biologist can harmlessly ignore the development and importance of the theory of spontaneous generation.

A principle components factor analysis shows that the respondents can be divided into five subgroups: the Promoters and Community Builders, the Feel-at-Home Comfortable Users, the Addicts, the Socializers, and the Introverted Chess Focus. The success of ICC stems from its support of all of these subgroups, as well as intrinsic factors in its environment that continue to attract volunteers from the regular member corps. Much of ICC's success that we find in this case follows prescriptive advice from prior virtual community literature, such as improving access to large-scale information resources, facilitating economic transactions, and combating information overload.

This ad hoc process is used because the principal way to measure the utility of changes to a program is to play many games against other programs and interpret the results.

IBLT proposes five learning mechanisms in the context of a decision-making process: instance-based knowledge, recognition-based retrieval, adaptive strategies, necessity-based choice, and feedback updates. IBLT suggests in DDM people learn with the accumulation and refinement of instances, containing the decision-making situation, action, and utility of decisions. As decision makers interact with a dynamic task, they recognize a situation according to its similarity to past instances, adapt their judgment strategies from heuristic-based to instance-based, and refine the accumulated knowledge according to feedback on the result of their actions. The IBLT's learning mechanisms have been implemented in an ACT-R cognitive model. Through a series of experiments, this paper shows how the IBLT's learning mechanisms closely approximate the relative trend magnitude and performance of human data. Although the cognitive model is bounded within the context of a dynamic task, the IBLT is a general theory of decision making applicable to other dynamic environments.",

However, in shogi (Japanese chess) the classic approach of building a large opening book of known positions is infeasible. In this paper, we present a different approach for opening and middle game play in shogi. This method uses board maps that assign values to each square for each piece in a number of different formations. Hill-climbing is then used to guide pieces to optimal squares. We define board maps for defensive piece formations (castles), attacking formations (assaults) and for recognizing the type of opening position. Results show that using board maps in combination with hill-climbing significantly improves the playing strength of a shogi program. Furthermore, using maps for both castles and assaults is better than using only maps for castles.",

This survey is based on a total of 75 scripts, not all of which were complete. I used a marking scheme of one point for a correct answer, with an additional one point for a partially correct reason, or two points for a completely correct reason.

In this paper we present a source browsing tool that improves the developer's ability to work with crosscutting concerns by providing better support for exploring code. Our tool helps the developer to remain oriented while exploring and navigating across a code base. The cognitive burden placed on a developer is reduced by avoiding disorienting view switches and by providing an explicit representation of the exploration process in terms of exploration paths. While our tool is generally useful, good navigation support is particularly important when exploring crosscutting concerns.",
         "Introduction": "Consider the scenario of a software developer wanting to reuse part of a particular application's code base because it contains functionality she needs in another application she is developing. The developer will need to track down the potentially scattered pieces of code that constitute the desired functionality and refactor the code to bring them together into one or more modules. This can be a challenging task because not only are the parts of the code she is trying to identify scattered across several modules, they are also tangled up with each other and with the rest of the code through many different types of relationships."

ProbCut and its improved variant Multi-ProbCut (MPC) have been shown to be effective in Othello and Shogi, but there had not been any report of success in the game of chess previously. This paper discusses our implementation of ProbCut and MPC in the chess engine \u00d6 \u00d8\u00dd. Initial test results suggest that the MPC version of \u00d6 \u00d8\u00dd is stronger than the original version of \u00d6 \u00d8\u00dd: it searches deeper in promising lines and defeated the original \u00d6 \u00d8\u00dd +22 \u00bd\u00bc \u00bf\u00be (59.4%) in a 64-game match. Incorporating MPC into \u00d6 \u00d8\u00dd also increased its tournament performance against another strong chess program: \u00d6 \u00d8\u00dd's speed chess tournament score went up from 51% to 56%.",
         "Introduction": "Computer chess has been an AI research topic since the invention of the computer, and it has come a long way. Nowadays, the best computer chess programs and the best human grandmasters play at roughly the same level. Most of the successful chess programs use the so-called brute-force approach, in which the program has limited chess knowledge and relies on a fast search algorithm to find the best move. There has been much research on improving the original minimax algorithm for finding moves in two player perfect information games. Enhancements range from sound backward pruning (alpha-beta search), over using transposition tables and iterative deepening, to selective search heuristics that either extend interesting lines of play or prune uninteresting parts of the search tree."

This paper investigates a new move-ordering heuristic in chess, namely the Neural MoveMap (NMM) heuristic. The heuristic uses a neural network to estimate the likelihood of a move being the best in a certain position. The moves considered more likely to be the best are examined first. We develop an enhanced approach to apply the NMM heuristic during the search, by using a weighted combination of the neural-network scores and the history-heuristic scores. Moreover, we analyse the influence of existing game databases and opening theory on the design of the training patterns. The NMM heuristic is tested for middle-game chess positions by the program CRAFTY. The experimental results indicate that the NMM heuristic outperforms the existing move ordering, especially when a weighted-combination approach is chosen.",
         "Introduction": "Most game-playing programs for two-person zero-sum games use the alpha-beta algorithm. The efficiency of alpha-beta is closely related to the size of the expanded search tree and depends mainly on the order in which the moves are considered. Inspecting good moves first increases the likelihood of cut-offs that decrease the size of the search tree."

In order for a theory to meet with wide-spread acceptance, it is important that the model be reproducible and comprehensible by independent researchers. However, the complexity of computational models can make the task of replication all but impossible. Previous authors have suggested that computer models should be developed using high-level specification languages or large amounts of documentation. We argue that neither suggestion is sufficient, as each deals with the prescriptive definition of the model, and does not aid in generalising the use of the model to new contexts. Instead, we argue that a computational model should be released as three components: (a) a well-documented implementation; (b) a set of tests illustrating each of the key processes within the model; and (c) a set of canonical results, for reproducing the model's predictions in important experiments. The included tests and experiments would provide the concrete exemplars required for easier comprehension of the model, as well as a confirmation that independent implementations and later versions reproduce the theory's canonical results.",

         "Introduction": "Machine learning is the branch of artificial intelligence that studies learning methods for creating intelligent systems. These systems are trained with the use of a learning algorithm for a domain specific problem or task. One of these machine learning methods is reinforcement learning. With reinforcement learning algorithms an agent can improve its performance by using the feedback it gets from the environment. Game-playing is a very popular machine learning research domain for AI. This is due to the fact that board games offer a fixed environment, easy measurement of taken actions (result of the game) and enough complexity. AI-search algorithms also play an important role in game playing programs. Learning takes place by showing database games of strong human players to our agent. We make use of database games because this saves a lot of time compared to playing against itself or against an other opponent. Watching a database game takes less than a second, while playing a game itself consumes much more time. This is because database games are al-ready played, it is therefore not necessary for the agent to search for moves to be played. This saves thousands of evaluation function calls per move. Learning on database games is not a completely new idea. Some researchers made use of database games in order to learn an evaluation function. "

Mis \u00e0 part le \u00ab trait \u00bb, c'est-\u00e0-dire la disposition des pi\u00e8ces blanches et du premier coup, une totale sym\u00e9trie lie les joueurs. Le probl\u00e8me de la partie est justement celui d'une rupture. Il faut sortir de cette parit\u00e9 dont le destin est forc\u00e9ment la nullit\u00e9 ; d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibrer le syst\u00e8me, briser le miroir. Il suffit d'une f\u00ealure, d'une poussi\u00e8re, d'une \u00ab impr\u00e9cision \u00bb pour que le couple ne soit plus en balance. Steinitz pr\u00e9f\u00e8re attendre la faute et l'exploiter d\u00e8s qu'elle survient. Lasker se propose au contraire de la provoquer, \u00e9bauchant une strat\u00e9gie dialectique qui prend en compte les facteurs \u00ab subjectifs \u00bb. Mais d\u00e8s que le fl\u00e9au s'incline l\u00e9g\u00e8rement, le vainqueur peut pousser jusqu'\u00e0 son terme l'avantage acquis. Le jeu prend en compte trois sortes de donn\u00e9es. Les pi\u00e8ces sont affect\u00e9es de puissances ; chaque \u00ab qualit\u00e9 \u00bb poss\u00e8de une \u00e9quivalence approximative en pions. Les cases sont plus ou moins importantes. L'arithm\u00e9tique et la topologie combinent leurs mesures dans la valeur pr\u00e9cise des pi\u00e8ces. En un moment donn\u00e9 cette valeur d\u00e9pend de leur rayon d'action, du nombre des cases qu'elles contr\u00f4lent, des distances qu'elles peuvent parcourir. La perte d'un cavalier, par exemple, n'est pas aussi co\u00fbteuse quand il se trouve au bord de l'\u00e9chiquier. Par ailleurs, la chronologie des coups modifie l'\u00e9valuation. La perte de ce cavalier est moins grave s'il n'a fait qu'un seul mouvement depuis le d\u00e9but de la partie ; plus lourde au contraire s'il lui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fallu trois sauts pour se placer en",
         "Introduction": "territoire ennemi. Sa chute entra\u00eene alors celle des \u00ab temps \u00bb, surtout si la pi\u00e8ce qui s'\u00e9change avec lui n'a fait qu'un mouvement sur l'\u00e9chiquier. Les cases sont valoris\u00e9es selon leurs relations strat\u00e9giques avec les pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 mater, les rois. Elles sont donc affect\u00e9es par le dispositif du jeu, la pr\u00e9sence de telle ou telle pi\u00e8ce dans la proximit\u00e9, sur les diagonales, etc. Bien des parties se jouent autour de l'occupation ou du contr\u00f4le d'une ou deux des soixante-quatre cases, le plus souvent au centre de l'\u00e9chiquier. Une troisi\u00e8me dimension, temporelle, surd\u00e9termine ce complexe \u00ab alg\u00e9brique \u00bb, quand les joueurs disposent d'un capital de temps identique et limit\u00e9. \u00c0 l'extr\u00eame un \u00ab blitz \u00bb, une guerre \u00e9clair, oblige les deux adversaires \u00e0 r\u00e9gler leurs comptes en quelques minutes, au coup pour coup. La vitesse, comme dans les duels de westerns, fait alors la diff\u00e9rence. Dans tous les cas aucun texte signifiant, aucun effet de sens ne doit d\u00e9ranger les strat\u00e8ges aux prises avec les logiques abstraites des nombres, des espaces et des temps. Le choix des coups doit \u00eatre libre de toute indexation inconsciente. Comme le dit justement A. Green : \u00ab Les joueurs ne sont pas cens\u00e9s avoir d'inconscient. Ils ne font pas d'actes manqu\u00e9s, rien que des fautes. Le postulat est que chacun joue pour gagner et qu'il n'y a qu'une fa\u00e7on de gagner. \u00bb "

Based on participant observation in the chess community and interviews with twenty amateur chess players, it examines the most relevant issues to players as they form their lines of action during play. It considers the following dimensions: incorporation of routine activity and style, role taking, impression management, engrossment, and composure. By examining these dimensions, we can gain an understanding of strategic activity as a generic social process. Further, drawing connections from strategic activity in chess to other areas of human group life indicates directions for future research.",

[Note 1] At the same time there is a tradition that proposes that what we do in the humanities is a form of play, even if it is serious play. In theorists like Huizinga, Bakhtin, and Gadamer play is presented as a component of humanities practice. The playful dimension of the dialogue of the humanities is that which distinguishes our (hermeneutical) methods from those in the social and natural sciences. If we want to resist becoming a (human) science we need to reassert the playfulness of representation and interpretation.

In 1997, Deep Blue stunned the world by narrowly winning the match. Was Deep Blue the best chess player in the world? Or was the result a fluke? We had no answer, as IBM immediately retired Deep Blue after the match. A frustrated Kasparov wanted another chance to play the computer, but it never happened.",

Needless to say, I was very upset since the chance to be part of a FIDE world championship was very exciting to me. However, I was also invited to attend a conference that was to immediately follow the match, giving me the chance to attend games 5 and 6 (costing me only one week of classes). So, off to Jerusalem I would go -until the FIDE match was postponed! I still had my ticket to Jerusalem, so I went anyway to participate in the conference.

In all games compiled, 18 situation of intense confidence/optimism and 20 of intense helplessness/hopelessness were observed. Results: Intense affects of HE/HO were associated with decreasing HF-HRV (Fisher exact test, p \u03ed .003), increasing \"nervousness\" (p \u03ed .0005), decreasing \"optimism\" (p \u03ed .0005), and decreasing \"calmness\" (p \u03ed .0005). Conclusions: Investigation of championship chess game players with an ELO strength \u0546 2300 in a natural field setting revealed increasing HE/HO being associated with reduced HF-HRV suggestive of vagal withdrawal.

We have played tens of thousands of simulated chess games to compare how different kinds of advantage contribute to overcoming an opponent. This has allowed us to quantify the effects of search depth, material strength, and tempo on game outcomes. The results indicate that tempo and material are both advantageous, but that the degree of advantage is highly dependent on skill level. Skill level, as reflected by search depth, leverages small inequalities in material or tempo. In addition, searching one move deeper than an otherwise equally matched opponent equates to an advantage of between 85%-98%.",

The playing of chess involves looking ahead at hypothetical move progressions, and assessing the values of positions that arise from these. Strong players are able to look many moves ahead, and take into account a great number of positional nuances. We have set out to quantify the extent to which various factors contribute to chess-playing strength, and to examine the relationship between these factors."

Of these 508 students, 64 were regular players of competitive chess. Data from the Australian Schools Science Competition were Rasch scaled and placed on a single scale for all the grades. Multilevel analysis using hierarchical linear modelling was employed to test the effects of the hypothesised variables. No significant effect of the playing of chess on the scholastic performance was found, suggesting that previous results showing positive effects may have been due to other factors such as general intelligence or normal development. It is suggested that this combination of Rasch scaling and multilevel analysis is a powerful tool for exploring such areas where the research design has proven difficult in the past.",

While brute-force techniques have recently proven to be a viable method for modeling domains with smaller search spaces, such as checkers and chess, the same techniques cannot succeed in more complex domains, such as shogi or go. This research uses a cognitive-based modeling strategy to develop a heuristic search technique based on cognitive thought processes with minimal domain specific knowledge. The cognitive-based search technique provides a significant reduction in search space complexity and, furthermore, enables the search paradigms to be extended to domains that are not typically thought of as search domains such as aerial combat or corporate takeovers.",

Nobody has challenged this statement. I make a parallel claim. The number of peripheral activities generated by chess exceeds that of all other games combined. These activities range from those only slightly removed from over-the-board chess to those where the game is almost irrelevant. It is impossible to list them all, but here are some. Playing in non face-to-face mode, e.g. by correspondence, on the internet, or against a computer; playing heterodox versions, e.g. progressive chess; composition (with its own many specialities); knight tours; computer programming; literature; fine art; decorative art; collecting. We have experts on chess-related philately, pub signs, beer mats, gardens, New Orleans Mardi Gras doubloons. Almost no aspect is untouched. Despite this rich diversity there appears to have been no study of chess diagrams, a topic that bears upon art, history, literature, the design of chessmen, psychology, type design, printing technique, etc. After I have discussed the diagram's evolution, and development, and also considerations of design, I hope that you will agree that this is a worthwhile area of study.",

In the learning phase of the experiment, participants in three conditions either observed (i.e., the control condition), predicted, or self-explained and predicted the moves of the computer playing an endgame of chess. In the test phase participants played five versions of the endgame against the computer. The participants in the self-explanation condition more often checkmated the black king than those in the two other conditions. No differences emerged between the prediction and control condition. Moreover, the self-explanation condition showed better understanding of the principles of the endgame than the two other conditions. Even for novices, and in a visuospatial task, generating self-explanations while studying had a positive effect on learning. Participants in the self-explanation condition showed better understanding of the principles that underlie the endgame, as indicated by the fact that they more often made the optimal move.",

The validity of these tasks was established using external criteria based on the Elo chess rating system. Results from a representative sample of active chess players (N = 234) showed that the ACT is a very reliable test for chess expertise, and that ACT has high predictive validity (r \u2248 .8). Several hypotheses about the relations between chess expertise, chess knowledge, motivation, and memory were tested. Incorporating response latencies in test scores is shown to be useful as this leads to an increase in criterion validity, in particular for relatively easy items.",

After an investigation into merels games and game boards, the route of circle and square motifs from Eurasian and Egyptian symbolism into Christianity is reviewed. It seems that the Christian meaning of the square was transferred to the merels board and, together with other elements, was used in folk art for Christian magic. Some merels boards can be explained this way, the meaning of others remains speculative. This interpretation is restricted to the Christian domain, in other parts of the world, for example in the case of a tombstone from Pend\u017eikent (Tad\u017eikistan), the meaning remains nebulous.",

The approach presented is fast enough to give results within minutes to hours when a normal PC is used. The computations with our program \"Endgame Freezer\" on the sample position Shirov vs. Fishbein in Section 3 took about eight minutes to complete, for example.",
         "Introduction": "When analyzing endgames in chess one is often in the unfortunate position that there are too many pieces left to look it up in currently available endgame databases. On the other hand the position examined may be too complex to be solved by using ordinary chess playing software. The main idea of the concept presented is to perform a retrograde analysis, but reduce the index space for the resulting database by orders of magnitudes. This reduction leads not only to space savings but to big time savings, making this approach usable as a real time analyzing tool. Former work on the subject of retrograde analysis has either tried to solve a certain material balance in total or at least with hard coded restrictions, i. e. van der Herik, Herschberg, and Naka constucted the database KRP(a2)-KbBP(a3) in 1987 "

         "Abstract": "Kriegspiel is a Chess variant similar to wargames, in which players have to deal with uncertainty. Kriegspiel increases the difficulty typical of Chess by hiding from each player his opponent's moves. Although it is a two person game it needs a referee, whose task consists in accepting the legal moves and rejecting the illegal ones, with respect to the real situation. Neither player knows the whole history of moves and each player has to guess the state of the game on the basis of messages received from the referee. A player's try may result legal or illegal, and a legal move may prove to be a capture or a check. The paper describes the rationale of a program to play basic endgames of Kriegspiel, where a player has left only the King. These endings have been theoretically studied with rule-based mechanisms, whereas few researches exist on a gametree-based approach. We show how the branch of game tree can be reduced in order to employ an evaluation function and a search algorithm. Then we deal with game situations dependent on stochastic element and we show how we resolve them during the tree visit.",
         "Introduction": "Kriegspiel is a Chess variant similar to wargames, in which players have to deal with uncertainty. All Chess rules are valid, but the players are not informed of their opponent's moves. Although it is a two person game, it needs a referee, whose task consists in accepting the legal moves and rejecting the illegal ones, with respect to the real situation. As the game progresses, each player tries to guess the position of his opponent's pieces by trying moves to which the referee can stay silent, if the move is legal, or he can announce \"illegal move\", if the move is illegal. Then the player has to make another try. If the move is legal and it gives check or captures a piece, the referee says \"check\" or \"capture\", respectively. Moreover, in order to speed up the game if a Pawn can capture an opponent's piece this is also announced."

         "Abstract": "Two types of mechanisms may underlie chess skill: fast mechanisms, such as recognition, and slow mechanisms, such as search through the space of possible moves and responses. Speed distinguishes these mechanisms, so I examined archival data on blitz chess (5 min for the whole game), in which the opportunities for search are greatly reduced. If variation in fast processes accounts for substantial variation in chess skill, performance in blitz chess should correlate highly with a player's overall skill. In addition, restricting search processes should tend to equalize skill difference between players, but this effect should decrease as overall skill level increases. Analyses of three samples of blitz chess tournaments supported both hypotheses. Search is undoubtedly important, but up to 81% of variance in chess skill (measured by rating) was accounted for by how players performed with less than 5% of the normal time available.",

We submitted players to a problem-solving task with complex positions. We found a strong skill effect in depth of search, rate of search, and number of nodes generated. At the level of strong masters, the absolute values of these variables were much higher than in previous studies (sometimes 10 times higher). Supplementary data on memory, practice, reaction times, and timeconstrained decision making (a maximum decision time of 10 seconds) indicated that players' behaviour was consistent with the behaviour of players previously studied in the literature and with predictions of theories based on pattern recognition. Beyond adding support to the hypothesis that both the ability to search and pattern recognition are relevant aspects of expert thinking, these results are important in showing that previous research has vastly underestimated experts' search potential. We conclude that long-term memory knowledge allows both extensive search and rapid evaluation when making decisions under time pressure. Players adaptively use either problemsolving method depending on the demands of the task.",

We show how a recent theory of expert memory (the template theory, Gobet & Simon, 1996,   2000)  accounts for most of these data. However, how the mind's eye filters out relevant from irrelevant information is still underspecified in the theory. We describe two experiments addressing this question, in which chess games are presented visually, move by move, on a board that contains irrelevant information (static positions, semi-static positions, and positions changing every move). The results show that irrelevant information affects chess masters only when it changes during the presentation of the target game. This suggests that novelty information is used by the mind's eye to select incoming visual information and separate \"figure\" and \"ground.\" Mechanisms already present in the template theory can be used to account for this novelty effect.",
         "Introduction": "Mental imagery, and in particular visual mental imagery, has been the subject of intensive research in psychology. This research is perhaps best known for the protracted debate of whether imagery is made possible by propositions or by analogue mental images.

Car, contrairement aux jeux de course, ici les joueurs sont adversaires, et non plus concurrents. Les pions n'ont plus \u00e0 suivre un parcours lin\u00e9aire mais peuvent se mouvoir sur le plateau sur plusieurs directions.

This paper deals with the development of a visual interface to play Kriegspiel over the Internet Chess Club. The interface is intelligent insofar as it is able to interpret the referee's messages obtained by the ICC server, offering the player an intuitive visualization of such messages, in terms of graphic abstractions which represent the invisible pieces of the opponent. In this sense the interface is able to let light into the dark side of the chessboard.",

An intelligent agent acts as a referee and a tutor to the novice. In addition, different interaction modalities, such as natural voice synthesis and speech recognition are added into the system.

         "Abstract": "Essentially all data mining algorithms assume that the datagenerating process is independent of the data miner's activities. However, in many domains, including spam detection, intrusion detection, fraud detection, surveillance and counter-terrorism, this is far from the case: the data is actively manipulated by an adversary seeking to make the classifier produce false negatives. In these domains, the performance of a classifier can degrade rapidly after it is deployed, as the adversary learns to defeat it. Currently the only solution to this is repeated, manual, ad hoc reconstruction of the classifier. In this paper we develop a formal framework and algorithms for this problem. We view classification as a game between the classifier and the adversary, and produce a classifier that is optimal given the adversary's optimal strategy. Experiments in a spam detection domain show that this approach can greatly outperform a classifier learned in the standard way, and (within the parameters of the problem) automatically adapt the classifier to the adversary's evolving manipulations.",
         "Introduction": "Many major applications of KDD share a characteristic that has so far received little attention from the research community: the presence of an adversary actively manipulating the data to defeat the data miner. In these domains, deployment of a KDD system causes the data to change so as to make the system ineffective. For example, in the domain of email spam detection, standard classifiers like naive Bayes were initially quite successful (e.g., "

         "Abstract": "s work presents a curious anomaly to the historian and philosopher trying to understand the development of classic Artificial Intelligence (AI). Simon was one of most influential figures in AI since its birth, and yet it is always with some difficulties that his work can be made to fit within the received canon of AI's development and goals. In fact, he differed from every other figure in early AI on most counts: in terms of the recognized intellectual heritage of AI, of his own background and training, of the goals he set for his own AI work and the assessment criteria he accepted. I will argue that these differences provide important clues toward a reevaluation of the relationship between Artificial Intelligence and Herbert Simon's work that may change our current understanding of both. On the one hand, classic Artificial Intelligence (or Complex Information Processing, as Simon preferred to call it for a number of years), provided the tool he needed to pursue a much broader research agenda that strove to encompass human beings in their cognitive, emotional, social, and political dimensions. On the other hand, AI's curious status as the discipline that straggles the boundaries between engineering, science, and philosophy can be recast as the tool that allowed researchers to pursue philosophy's old goals with an alternative methodology. From this perspective, Simon's version of Artificial Intelligence becomes a full-fledged form of \"anti-philosophy\" as ambitious and broad-ranging as old-fashioned metaphysics and as revolutionary as the latter in the radical refashioning of its methodology. It follows that a philosophical assessment of AI, at in least in its Simonian incarnation, must be more farreaching than it is usually thought. At the methodological level, it must discuss whether AI's invention of computer simulation as the tool that overcomes the a-priori/a-posteriori distinction by actually producing the behavior it wants to explain is really adequate to the job at hand. At the content level, it must be willing to broaden the scope of AI theories and consider them not as just one possible version of a theory of mental processes (\"cognitivism,\" say), but as",

Its scope is limited to a historically-based discussion of the relationship between research in Artificial Intelligence and Herbert Simon's work as a whole, and it takes its start from the 'received view' about AI."

         "Introduction": "I ricercatori in AI hanno sempre vigorosamente affermato che questa concentrazione sull'ambito ludico fu completamente strumentale e del tutto esterna alle motivazioni e teorie cognitive proposte. I giochi di societa', affermano, diventarono un tema favorito della ricerca perche' costituivano un ambito ideale in cui mettere alla prova una simulazione delle capacita' cognitive di un programma. Gli scacchi, ad esempio, possono essere descritti con una dozzina di semplici regole, e tuttavia il gioco e' cosi' complesso che le migliori intelligenze non riescono a dominarlo completamente. D'altra parte, dal momento che siamo soliti considerare un buon giocatore di scacchi un ottimo esempio di intelligenza in generale, ne consegue che un programma in grado di giocare bene a scacchi si deve considerare quale esempio di comportamento intelligente in generale. Il lavoro sugli scacchi e altri giochi di societa' permette dunque alla ricerca in AI di lasciare da parte complessit\u00e0 estrinseche e di concentrarsi sull'essenziale del comportamento intelligente.

         "Introduction": "Suppose you own a few shares of a company that intends to sell off a part of its business, the law requires the approval of the shareholders. The report of an independent consulting firm strongly recommends the transaction, and so does the supervisory board, your bank and the Wall Street Journal. Do you attend the shareholders' meeting? Is your propensity to participate diminished by the fact that all experts of which you are aware are in perfect agreement?"

The game of chess lends itself extremely well to such an experiment by virtue of the innately parallel nature of game tree analysis. We believe that ChessBrain is the first project of its kind to address and solve many of the challenges posed by stringent time limits in distributed calculations. These challenges include ensuring adequate security against organized attacks; dealing with non-simultaneity and network lag; result verification; sharing of common information; optimizing redundancy and intelligent work distribution.",
         "Introduction": "The ChessBrain project was founded in January 2002. Its principal aim was to investigate the use of distributed computation for a time-critical application. Chess was chosen because of its innately parallelisable nature, and also because of the authors' personal interest in the game. "

         "Introduction": "An important task in designing spoken dialogue systems is to decide whether a system should accept (consider correctly recognised) or reject (assume misrecognition) a user utterance. This decision is often based on acoustic confidence scores computed by the speech recogniser and a fixed confidence rejection threshold. However, a drawback of this approach is that it does not take into account that in particular dialogue situations some utterances are pragmatically more plausible than others. "

This includes the identification and a formalization (for the first time) of key game properties that are important for TD-Learning and a discussion of different methods of generate training data. Also included is the development of a TD-learning game system (including a game-independent benchmarking engine) which is capable of learning any zero-sum two-player board game. The primary purpose of the development of this system is to allow potential improvements of the system to be tested and compared in a standardized fashion.

To what extent does transfer exist, and how can we facilitate its presence? Is the order in which a curriculum is taught important? How can instruction produce learning with understanding, as opposed to only skill accretion? How can we harness the new resources offered by advances in technology to improve the education we provide to our children?"

We suggest that the link is deeper; there needs to be a fit between the task and the group's cognitive structures as mapped to the groupware structures. In this paper we address this shortcoming by integrating recent theories of cognition (distributed cognition, transactive memory and template theory) from the perspective of electronic collaboration. We refine the concept of cognitive fit as applied to group work and offer propositions for further study. We show that template core data is used during situation assessment and that slot data refines response selection. Finally, we propose several techniques by which the group cognitive effort can be minimized, thereby leaving more capacity for the collective task. This approach is especially applicable to naturalistic group decision situations.",

The strength of some chess programs can be compared to top-level human players. Nevertheless, most of the AI research has been focused on the refinement of evaluation functions which are used to search the NP-complete solution space. Some optimizations have also been made to the arrangement in which possible moves are examined by the search algorithm. In this article we take a nouvelle approach to the generation of chess moves with the help of multi-agent based systems. We design a multi-agent system which represents the pieces of a chess battlefield and we feed the search algorithm with the most promising move(s) from the point of view of the individual agents. Thus, we take into account the individual decisions (tactics) to define the strategy, as well as cutting out the search space. We plan to make a prototype implementation of the multi-agent based chess move generator system (MAB-CMGS) using the FIPA-OS architecture to test the overall system behaviour and achievable chess power.",

To normalize the chessboard image with different perspectives, the chessboard corners are found and each chessboard square is divided into 8*8 smaller squares.

This approach can reduce search effort by a large margin. However, it suffers from the so-called Graph History Interaction (GHI) problem, which causes errors in games containing repeated positions. This paper presents a practical solution to the GHI problem that combines and extends previous techniques. Because our scheme is general, it is applicable to different game tree search algorithms and to different domains. As demonstrated with the two algorithms \u03b1\u03b2 and df-pn in the two games checkers and Go, our scheme incurs only a very small overhead, while guaranteeing the correctness of solutions.",
         "Introduction": "Heuristic search is an important topic in Artificial Intelligence. Search algorithms have many practical applications in areas such as theorem-proving, bio-informatics, and games. In particular, games have been regarded as useful test beds for search algorithms. Efficient search algorithms were shown to improve the strength of game-playing programs. Experiments in many different domains and with many different programs have shown a strong positive correlation between the depth of a search and the strength of a program. Therefore, programmers have invested a lot of effort to enhance the search performance of their programs."

In this paper we consider a tactical sub-problem that needs to be addressed on the way to strong computer generated forces: abstract combat games in which a small number of inhomogeneous units battle with each other in simultaneous move rounds until all members of one group are eliminated. We present and test several adversarial heuristic search algorithms that are able to compute reasonable actions in those scenarios using short time controls. Tournament results indicate that a new algorithm for simultaneous move games which we call \"randomized alpha-beta search\" (RAB) can be used effectively in the abstract combat application we consider. In this application it outperforms the other algorithms we implemented. We also show that RAB's performance is correlated with the degree of simultaneous move interdependence present in the game.",

It is not clear how to define a starting position on 3x3 board, so all possible positions were included. Rules are same with chess, except that due to the tiny board there is no castling and no double first move of pawn (and no en passant). Pawns promote when they reach the last rank -third for white and first for black. Does it look too simple for you? Read these pages, try to solve problems, then follow the correct line with the analysis board. Then tell me if 3x3 chess is still too simple or not. I hope you will enjoy this beautiful chess variant as much as I do."

Given the exponential nature of the growth of tree size, a naive search of all the possible moves in the game tree (i.e. the min-max algorithm) is time consuming, and the search level, as well as the strength of the program, will be severely limited. Pruning the unnecessary part of the game tree (game tree pruning) is an important issue in increasing search efficiency.",
         "Introduction": "Game tree search is an interesting topic in artificial intelligence. Using the enormous computing power of a modern computer, a computer program can enumerate all the possible scenarios af-ter a given game situation, and choose the best move. Game tree search has been applied to many board games, including chess, Chinese chess, and go. The state-of-the-art computer chess program (e.g. Deep Blue) is now able to beat the top human chess grandmaster. The current best Chinese chess program is ranked about six dan, and is expected to achieve the strength of grandmaster soon. On the contrary, the progress of computer Go is relatively slow, due to the fact Go emphasizes more on strategic thinking than tactical evaluation. Now the current best program can only achieve the level of six kyu, which is much much weaker than most of the human Go player."

         "Abstract": "Game tree search is the core of most attempts to make computers play games. Yet another approach is to store all possible positions in a database and to precompute the true values for all the positions. The databases allow computers to play optimally, in the sense that they will win every game once they reach a winning position. Moreover, they will never lose from a draw or win position. This is the situation that we find in games like Connect-4, in endgames of chess and in many other settings. Nevertheless, it has been observed that the programs do not play strongly when they have to play a tournament with strong, but non-perfect human players attending. In this paper we propose a mixture of game tree search and the database approach which attacks this problem on the basis of a known theoretical error analysis in game trees. Experiments show encouraging results.",
         "Introduction": "Game playing computer programs become stronger and stronger. One reason is that the search procedures of forecasting programs become faster and more sophisticated. Simultaneously, database approaches have been further developed. Some 6-men chess endgames -that are chess endgames with no more than 6 pieces on board -have been solved, and several easier games like Connect-4 as well. This means that for every position of the given game, the true value is known. Astonishingly, it is just this kind of perfection that leaves the mark of stupidity. When such a 'perfect' program reaches a winning position, it will always win, and when it reaches a draw position, it will never lose. Nevertheless, when it plays against fallible opponents, it is often not able to bring the opponent into trouble and to reach a better position than it had at the beginning. The programs cannot distinguish between 'easy' and 'difficult' positions for their opponents. This problem has rarely been tackled "

In this paper, a minimax model that -unlike most work in this area -uses real numbers for positions' values is introduced. It usually does not exhibit pathology. Mechanism that improves evaluation with depth is explained. Comparison to chess is made, showing the model not to be unrealistic.",
         "Introduction": "Game playing has long been a test bed for artificial intelligence research and many techniques developed there have found application elsewhere. Game-playing programs typically choose their moves by searching the game tree: they build the tree of possible future moves and positions to some arbitrary depth, heuristically evaluate the leaves, and then propagate their values to the root using the minimax principle. Practical aspects of the technique are well understood and it is known that everything else being equal, the deeper the tree is searched, the better the program plays. However, mathematical analyses indicate that under seemingly sensible conditions, minimaxing amplifies the error in the heuristic evaluation, so increased depth of search increases the error.

         "Abstract": "In game-playing programs relying on the minimax principle, deeper searches generally produce better evaluations. Theoretical analyses, however, suggest that in many cases minimaxing amplifies the noise introduced by the heuristic function used to evaluate the leaves of the game tree, leading to what is known as pathological behavior, where deeper searches produce worse evaluations. In most of the previous research, positions were evaluated as losses or wins. Dependence between the values of positions close to each other was identified as the property of realistic game trees that eliminates the pathology and explains why minimax is successful in practice. In this paper we present an alternative explanation that does not rely on value dependence. We show that if real numbers are used for position values, position values tend to be further apart at lower levels of the game tree, which leads to a larger proportion of more extreme positions, where error is less probable. Decreased probability of error in searches to greater depths is sufficient to eliminate the pathology and no additional properties of game trees are required.",
         "Introduction": "Most game-playing programs are based on the minimax principle. Such programs choose the best move by searching the game tree to a chosen depth, heuristically evaluating the leaves and then propagating their values to the root using the minimax principle. It is generally agreed that deeper searches produce better evaluations at the root. However, first attempts to explain this mathematically yielded the paradoxical result that minimaxing amplifies the error of the heuristic evaluations and that consequently deeper searches produce worse evaluations "

         "Abstract": "The application of self-play experiments to computer games was pioneered by Thompson in 1982 with his chess machine BELLE. Since then the technique has been widely used in a variety of games to train artificial players employing a range of artificial neural network architectures. Of particular note is the TD-learning Backgammon program of Tesauro developed in 1995. When developing artificial game players that learn by experience, it is generally possible to accelerate the training process through selfplay. Compared with training by humans, this confers the advantages of greater speed and a precise control of playing strength through parameter variation. In spite of these potential advantages, the use of self-play experiments is considered by many to be a treacherous road fraught with problems. The value of such experiments is unclear and the threshold of learning that can be achieved through self-play alone is unknown. There is the common-sense perception that only limited playing skill can be achieved through machine self-play, a notion that is challenged here. A new application that is immune from the problems associated with machine learning is the use of self-play experiments to test the integrity and fairness of games and modify the rules accordingly. We will show how the rules of a particular game, Perudo, can be analysed for fairness and how the excessive positive feedback that arises when forces become unbalanced can be curbed. We use the notion of fair in the same sense as in a soccer game -if a team loses a goal, neglecting psychological effects, the chance of losing a second goal is not significantly changed. It is recognised that the cumulative growth in advantage is part of many games and that it is inappropriate to alter the rules in these cases. However the rate at which advantages grow can be moderated by rule alterations. We will also consider the application of the technique to a range of traditional games. In chess, for example, White is considered to have an advantage over Black. The imbalance can be determined for different playing strengths and extrapolated. We will show that the principles can be extended to the more complex situations of computer games and propose that the development of unintelligent agents to explore game play is advantageous.",

In this paper, we introduce an efficient induction method of player ratings from tournament results.

         "Introduction": "Machine learning is the branch of artificial intelligence that studies learning methods for creating intelligent systems. These systems are trained with the use of a learning algorithm for a domain specific problem or task. One of these machine learning methods is reinforcement learning. With reinforcement learning algorithms an agent can improve its performance by using the feedback it gets from the environment. Game-playing is a very popular machine learning research domain for AI. This is due to the fact that board games offer a fixed environment, easy measurement of taken actions (result of the game) and enough complexity. AI-search algorithms also play an important role in game playing programs. Learning takes place by showing database games of strong human players to our agent. We make use of database games because this saves a lot of time compared to playing against itself or against an other opponent. Watching a database game takes less than a second, while playing a game itself consumes much more time. This is because database games are al-ready played, it is therefore not necessary for the agent to search for moves to be played. This saves thousands of evaluation function calls per move. Learning on database games is not a completely new idea. Some researchers made use of database games in order to learn an evaluation function. "

They are assisted in this task by an Intelligent Agent (IA) with considerable knowledge about the environment.

The use of a combination of virtual and real worlds allows us to leverage the advantages from both the worlds.",
         "Introduction": "Advances in virtual reality and 3-dimensional object modeling and visualization in the 1990's have led to the proliferation of a range of highly flexible software tools for the creation of a virtual world. Many applications in AR and tele-collaboration have utilized these tools effectively. While the quality of the visual images in these systems is impressive, the resulting scenarios are primarily virtual and pre-defined and for most part lack a connection to the real-world, to which the user(s) must react and respond, possibly in real-time. These systems are thus highly limited in their ability to help solve real-world problems requiring collaboration across a distance."

The article argues that correlation between a high branching factor in the game tree and having a winning move available is something that minimax implicitly takes into account and that this is at least partially responsible for its success.

It is a skill-related activity, and only very skilled players can construct the mental images required. This is why blindfold chess provides a good task with which to investigate the spatial memory and skilled mental images of expert players. In a PET investigation, we compared memory performance and problem solving in very experienced chess players with their performance in an attention task, in which the subjects classified the names of chess pieces. The memory task predominantly activated the temporal areas, whereas problem solving activated several frontal areas. The relevance of these findings to concepts such as general imagery, skilled imagery, apperception, and long-term working memory are discussed.",

         "Abstract": "Computer games research has had positive results in many areas of application. We used a chess playing applet to investigate distributed computation with centralized storage of computation results. The average branching factor of the chess game tree is about 30, making computation of the full game tree (to a depth of 30 moves or more) infeasible. However, as a contest between two players, the number of acceptable (strong) moves at any time is limited, making the branching factor of the tree of \"competent games\" small enough to make storing a pre-computed database of moves feasible with regard to storage space. Distributing the computation of the move database makes the computation feasible with regard to time. We describe a system using a Web browser applet for distributed computation of chess moves and a chess data server for storing the computation results. The database of moves speeds up the chess play of the applet (when the move is found in the database) and the distributed applet computation of moves generates the database. Moves computed on faster hardware to a deeper search depth replace moves computed with a shallower depth so the database evolves (contains stronger moves) as hardware becomes faster over time. Results from public testing over a one-year period are reported.",

         "Introduction": "It has been a trend since the 1980s to develop some robots or computers to play games with human being. Among all the games, chess got most enthusiasm. This is not only because chess is one of the most popular games all over the world, but also due to the reason that it is a game requiring high intelligence. Neural networks may be applied well in various practical areas, e.g. pattern recognition, signal processing, etc [l] -[3]. It is appropriate to use neural networks to solve some intelligent problems because neural networks are parallel, distributed systems with high fault-tolerance. In this paper, the authors tried to use feedfomard neural networks to learn the patterns in chess games. However, it is almost impossible to train a neural network to remember all changes and traps in a chess game since chess as a whole is too complex even for human's brain. Therefore, only some simplest cases of the end games, whose complete knowledge is available, were considered. The aim of the paper is to transform the end games infinmation into neural network structure.  (c) Fig. "

To meet the objective, research will be centered on artificial neural network (ANN) topology specifically for the purpose of creating a topology appropriate for complex decision making in a massively dimensional problem. Functionality of the system may be broken into three parts: the learning mode will be an automated process where the ANNs learn how to play from an extensive external database of games; while the playing and advisory modes of operation accept user interaction, taking move inputs from the player and providing the move(s) chosen by the system. Playing mode returns one move while advisory returns multiple. Figure ",

Deep search cannot detect the existence of a blockage, since its judgment is based solely on static evaluation, without taking the goals into consideration. In this paper we introduce a blockage detection method, which manages to detect a large set of blockage positions in pawn endgames, with practically no additional overhead. By examining different aspects of the pawn structure, it checks whether the pawns form a blockage which prevents the king from penetrating into the opponent's camp. It then checks several criteria to find out whether the blockage is permanent.",

An accurate evaluation function is indispensable for a strong shogi program. A shogi position is projected into a feature space which consists of feature variates charactering the position. Using such variates as input, we employ a multi-layer perceptron as a nonlinear evaluation function. Since it is not easy to obtain accurate evaluated values of positions, we employ reinforcement learning. Our experiments using hundreds of games show that the proposed method works well in obtaining a very accurate evaluation function for shogi, whose performance is comparable to that of a strong shogi program.",

It was widely played by the Jews in the Ghettoes. It was an essential portion of the equipment of the . . . minstrel.\" 2 If the romances, chansons d'aventure, and occasional legal documents are any indication, aristocratic women also played chess and sometimes excelled: the board was regarded as one acceptable point of contact between sexes. 3   Allusions to chess in medieval literature are numerous, from inclusions in lists of courtly pastimes, to accounts of chess masters, to legal briefs, to technical treatises, to a full-blown allegorical romance. On the technical side, medieval experimentation with the rules developed the slower Persian game into the seemingly perfected version played today.",

Its origins are traceable to Indian ashtapada boards commonly used among diceplaying games of that time. This game spread from culture to culture via several different means, periodically undergoing revision. Most chess players are aware of the radical reforms that shaped the game of chess during the Medieval Era, but probably only a few players are aware of the changes proposed by former World Champion Jos\u00e9 Raoul Capablanca in the 1920s. This paper focuses on the 80-square version of chess recommended by Capablanca, identifies some of the anomalies associated with Capablanca's chess, and proposes a slightly modified version of his setup as a plausible enhancement, called Gothic chess. New values for the pieces on the 10 \u00d7 8 board are derived. Subsequently, five Gothic-chess computer programs are introduced. Finally conclusions and perspectives are given.",

Gaming is, in many ways, a reflection of man's competitive spirit. We refer to virtually every aspect of life with gaming terminology, from romance to commerce, and we see our lives as a constant Darwinian struggle against both one another, and against the odds of the universe. However, there are two types of games which provide the most commonly-used gaming metaphors, and those are chess and the playing cards. These are the games most commonly played in the Western world throughout the last five centuries, familiar to any school child: one a game of strategy, the other a game, mostly, of chance. Research indicates, however, that the two systems of gaming may in fact have had a common origin."

Adem\u00e1s, hoy sabemos que el primer libro impreso en el mundo, Francesch Vicent(5), Valencia 1495, conten\u00eda 100 problemas de ajedrez la mayor\u00eda de ellos de ajedrez de la dama.

Although they were originally designed for transcriptomics, we argue that these algorithms are applicable to any type of -omics study (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics). Rank Products (RP), a strictly non-parametric test statistic to detect differentially regulated elements (genes, proteins, metabolites) in genome-wide screens. RP is particularly powerful for noisy data and low numbers of replicates and makes full use of the availability of a large number of parallel measurements that is typical of modern large-scale experiments. Iterative Group Analysis (iGA), a statistical method that makes the transition from regulated single elements to significant classes of elements, and thus provides an automatic functional annotation of an experiment. Graph-based iGA (GiGA), an extension of iGA that combines experimental data with a broad variety of biological annotations to highlight physiologically relevant regions in a given \"evidence graph\" (e.g., metabolic networks, signaling pathway diagrams, protein interaction maps). The sequential application of these techniques yields an increasingly abstract interpretation of experimental data that is at the same time quantitative, statistically rigorous, and biologically significant. The results can be used either as helpful tools to guide data visualization and exploration, or as the input for downstream computational applications in a systems biology framework.",

         "Abstract": "There exist several techniques for representing the chess board inside the computer in chess programms. The straight-forward-approach of just maintaining an array representing the 64 squares on a chessboard works ne, but has several drawbacks in move-generation as well as evaluation, which are frequently used in modern chess programs. Thus, the chess programming community has developed more advanced board representations, one of them beeing the bitboard representation. The basic idea is based on the observation that modern CPUs are 64bit-processors, i.e. the length of a word in machine language is often 64bit, which corresponds to the 64 squares on the chess board. The advantage of this representation lies in the availibility of very fast bit-manipulating operations (like AND, OR, NOT) on modern CPUs. It is therefor possible to construct very ecient chess programms on the basis of the bitboard-approach, because, roughly speaking, the CPU operates on all 64bit in parallel. In order to use the bitboard representation for an ecient move generation for sliding pieces, a renement called rotated bitboards is needed. In this paper the basic ideas as well as the concrete implementation of the rotated-bitboards move generator in our chess program FUSc# will be discussed. In the rst part the concepts of the bitboard-representation of the chess board, the advantage of bitboards in move generation and the reasons why rotated bitboards are needed for the generation of moves for sliding pieces are explained. In the second part, the concrete implementation of the move-generator in FUSc# is discussed, i.e. the ideas of part one can be studied in practice. Part three explains a technique how to verify the move-generator of a chess programm with the perft-command -after the general concept is described, it is used to show that the move-generator of FUSc# works 100% correct. Finally, in an outlook to the prospects of further research, it is discussed in how far the rotatedbitboards representation of the chess board will prot of the availibility of 64bit-processors (AMD64, IA64), and what future enhanchments could be done.",

We show how a recent theory of expert memory (the template theory; Gobet & Simon,  1996b, 2000)  accounts for most of these data. However, how the mind's eye filters out relevant from irrelevant information is still underspecified in the theory. We describe two experiments addressing this question, in which chess games are presented visually, move by move, on a board that contains irrelevant information (static positions, semistatic positions, and positions changing every move). The results show that irrelevant information affects chess masters only when it changes during the presentation of the target game. This suggests that novelty information is used by the mind's eye to select incoming visual information and separate ``figure'' and ``ground''. Mechanisms already present in the template theory can be used to account for this novelty effect.",

Masters showed no differences in brain activity when different degrees of structure and familiarity where compared; however, novices did show differences in brain activity in such contrasts. The most important differences were found in the contrast of stimulus familiarity with chess positions. In this contrast, there was an extended brain activity in bilateral frontal areas such as the anterior cingulate and the superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri; furthermore, posterior areas, such as posterior cingulate and cerebellum, showed great bilateral activation. These results strengthen the hypothesis that when performing a domain-specific task, experts activate different brain systems from that of novices. The use of the expertsversus-novices paradigm in brain imaging contributes towards the search for brain systems involved in cognitive processes.",

         "Introduction": "Although large displays could theoretically allow several users to work together and to move freely in a room, their associated interfaces are limited to contact devices that must generally be shared. Moreover when interacting together, users use natural powerful ways of communication like voice and gestures, but when interacting with a computer, they are still limited to poor means of interaction like pushing buttons. This paper describes a novel interface called SHIVA (Several-Humans Interface with Vision and Audio) designed to allow several users to interact remotely with a very large display by using both speech and gesture. From a stereo camera, the head and both hands of two users are detected and tracked in real time. The first detected hand position of each user is used to estimate the pointed direction and the second one is used for selection or to control a third axis in 3D applications. Then, the pointed direction is fused with n-best results from speech recognition to interpret the user multimodal command, also taking into account the application context (here a chess game). This paper is organized in the following manner. In the next section, some previous work on multi-person tracking and on pointing gesture recognition is discussed. Then our work novel contribution is presented. The following section describes the body parts detection and tracking. The next section deals with the modalities fusion and synchronisation. Then, some results are given."

         "Introduction": "This paper presents a fuzzy implementation for the tactics of the game of chess. Chess as been traditionally used for explaining fuzzy reasoning, and is often considered a platform of choice to test intelligent systems. However, an extensive search for applications of fuzzy sets, inference or reasoning to the game of chess, gives hardly any concrete results. One can find fuzzy improvements to classic tree search algorithms like, for example, fuzzy forward-pruning (which can obviously be applied to chess), but not a single relevant result in what concerns applying fuzzy to express or implement human chess knowledge. It is a fact that, chess, the ultimate measure of \"intelligence\" in old times, seems to have shed some of its gloss once it was discovered that you can do it quite well with alpha-beta pruning and a lot of sheer calculating power. However, chess knowledge is still arguably one of the factors that make good human chess players so hard to be beaten by a machine as long as time is not an issuefor instance, in e-mail based tournaments, humans have a large advantage over machines and their expertise is the defining winning factor."

Through chess, we learn how to analyze a situation by focusing on important factors and by eliminating distractions. We learn to devise creative solutions and put a plan into action.

We think almost anyone reading G&S would conclude that their message was not that thinking time leads to a loss in quality of play, but that amount of time makes very little (or as the their abstract and text said, \"slight\") difference. C&H's conclusion was that a reduction in thinking time makes a considerable difference-the message is not the same! We argued that the whole issue of pattern recognition vs. forward search is currently unresolvable, which seems clearly true since Gobet himself cannot tell us how much of a difference we would have to find to undermine his theory. 2   G&S analyzed then-world champion Garry Kasparov's performance in simultaneous play to estimate how much (or how little) his ability declined when his thinking time was divided among multiple opponents. However, G&S did not evaluate the uncertainty associated with their conclusion because they did not recognize the variability in their estimate of Kasparov's strength under the time limits in these displays. 3 A reanalysis of G&S's data using maximum likelihood estimation (see "

But not every picture is worth the space it occupies. What qualities make a diagram an effective and efficient conduit of information to the human mind? In this article we argue that the best diagrams depict information the same way that our internal mental representations do. That is, \"visual thinking\" operates largely on relatively sketchy, cartoon-like representations of the physical world, translating sensory input into efficient codes before storing and manipulating it. Effective diagrams will assist this process by stripping away irrelevant detail while preserving or highlighting essential information about objects and their spatial relations. We discuss several examples that illustrate this \"Representational Correspondence Principle,\" and we consider its implications for the design of systems that use diagrams to represent abstract, conceptual knowledge, such as social networks, financial markets, or web content hierarchies.",
         "Introduction": "Diagrams are uniquely powerful tools for communication. Everyone has heard the adage that a picture is worth a thousand words (or ten thousand, according to the Chinese version), and this adage bears repetition because it so often is correct. Diagrams, which we take to include information graphics and all other nonphotographic forms of visual communication, are usually good examples of this adage at work-but not simply because they save time or space. Rather, diagrams are useful because they make explicit and accessible to human users patterns among facts. Our brains have particular properties that must be respected if a diagram (or anything else) is to communicate effectively, and a good diagram exploits our strengths and does not fall prey to our limitations."

Variables representing accumulated time spent on serious study alone, tournament play, and formal instruction were all significant bivariate correlates of chess skill as measured by tournament performance ratings. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that among the activities measured, serious study alone was the strongest predictor of chess skill in both samples, and that a combination of various chessrelated activities accounted for about 40% of the variance in chess skill ratings. However, the relevance of tournament play and formal instruction to skill varied as a function of skill measurement time (peak vs. current) and age group (above vs. below 40 years). Chess players at the highest skill level (i.e. grandmasters) expended about 5000 hours on serious study alone during their first decade of serious chess play-nearly five times the average amount reported by intermediate-level players. These results provide further evidence to support the argument that deliberate practice plays a critical role in the acquisition of chess expertise, and may be useful in addressing pedagogical issues concerning the optimal allocation of time to different chess learning activities.",

The correspondence itself is proved by means of an explicit bijection. We also outline how lattice paths, or rat races, can be used to obtain generating functions for chess tableaux.

In four groups, we varied the JOL instruction (present versus absent) and the selection instruction (free number of move selections versus selection of at least two moves per chess exercise). After four learning trials, participants were required to play against a chess computer. In the learning phase, participants who were forced to select moves for restudy outperformed those who were free to select moves for restudy when predicting the next computer move, even after controlling for the actual number of restudied moves. Although the groups that did provide JOLs showed better self-regulatory behaviour, there were no or even negative performance differences between the groups that did provide JOLs and the groups that did not provide JOLs. This same pattern emerged in the test phase: Although no differences were found between the groups with and without JOLs, the groups that were forced to select moves for restudy outperformed the groups that were free in the number of move selections. These data show that, for novice chess players, the instruction to provide JOLs possibly places a high and ineffective load on working memory and therefore has no effect on learning a chess endgame. To examine the relation between prior knowledge and quality of self-regulation, further research is needed that examines the effect of the JOL and selection instruction in groups that differ in chess experience.",

But, in many cases, we do not have control of the relevant causal processes. Rather, we are confronted with an effect and must reconstruct its cause.

         "Abstract": "Despite the increasing number of interaction devices for virtual reality (VR) applications (e.g. datagloves, space balls, data-suits and so on), surprisingly very little attention has been given to the evaluation of VR interaction techniques or more generally to the usability of virtual reality environments (VRE). The main reasons for these limited efforts are probably that empirical user testing with VREs is difficult and timeconsuming and ergonomic rules or criteria and traditional HCI tools and methods are not well suited for VRE. Alternatively, the specification of interaction based on a formal method or notation provides a precise and unambiguous description that can be used to reason the user's actions while interacting with a VRE. In this paper, we propose a new approach to design interaction techniques in VRE, based on the use of a formal specification language: the ASUR notation. In the early stages of system design, time and effort are reduced by assisting the designers in considering alternative solutions and anticipating usability issues. To better explain the proposed methodology, we report an evaluation of selection and manipulation techniques in a virtual environment based on a chess game. The evaluation has been carried out in two ways: predictively, with the help of the ASUR notation, and empirically via user experiments. We present the outcomes of the empirical studies and demonstrate that the reasoning with the ASUR notation leads to similar but also results complementary to those obtained with the experiments.",
         "Introduction": "Interaction in virtual reality environments (VREs) is based on the responsive capability to detect and react to each user action executed with interaction techniques, using some kind of special (data gloves, H3D glasses) or conventional (mouse, keyboard, screen) device. Interaction techniques support different kinds of user actions such as: executing commands and entering data to select virtual objects; manipulating them; specifying actions and navigating in the environment."

In an enumerative chess problem, the set of moves in the solution is (usually) unique but the order is not, and the task is to count the feasible permutations via an isomorphic problem in enumerative combinatorics. Almost all enumerative chess problems have been \"series-movers\", in which one side plays an uninterrupted series of moves, unanswered except possibly for one move by the opponent at the end. This can be convenient for setting up enumeration problems, but we show that other problem genres also lend themselves to composing enumerative problems. Some of the resulting enumerations cannot be shown (or have not yet been shown) in series-movers.",

This commentary reviews how research on expertise originally focused on testing chess experts' memory as a convenient substitute for studies of actual performance, such as selecting the best move for chess positions. Most of the articles in the special issue illustrate a new trend towards capturing the expert performance with representative tasks in the laboratory and focus on how this superior performance is acquired through training and extended deliberate practice. With these and other advances in our knowledge of how experts acquire their superior skills, the study of expertise is establishing its most important implications for theoretical and applied cognitive psychology.",

         "Abstract": "A Game at Chess, la derni\u00e8re pi\u00e8ce de Thomas Middleton, \u00e9crite et repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en 1624, est souvent consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une pi\u00e8ce inclassable. Elle se d\u00e9marque des autres productions dramatiques de l'\u00e9poque -et de son auteur -par un grand nombre de particularit\u00e9s. Elle serait ainsi une sorte d'entit\u00e9 dramatique non-identifi\u00e9e, une cr\u00e9ation unique, curieux m\u00e9lange de diff\u00e9rentes traditions et de diff\u00e9rents modes ; m\u00e9lange opportuniste, indissociable du contexte politique et culturel qui l'a engendr\u00e9.",
         "Introduction": "L'originalit\u00e9 de la pi\u00e8ce vient donc peut-\u00eatre, paradoxalement, de l'utilisation de cette all\u00e9gorie du jeu d'\u00e9checs comme trame de l'oeuvre toute enti\u00e8re, comme unique d\u00e9cor de l'intrigue. On est loin en effet des rues ou des \u00e9choppes de Londres qui servent de cadre aux city comedies comme A Chaste Maid in Cheapside ou A Mad World, My Masters, ou des cours d'Italie ou d'Espagne, o\u00f9 se d\u00e9roule l'action de trag\u00e9dies comme Women Beware Women ou The Changeling. L'all\u00e9gorie transporte les spectateurs dans un monde irr\u00e9el o\u00f9 la vie est un jeu. Distanciation d'autant plus efficace dans A Game at Chess que l'action toute enti\u00e8re est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans l'Induction comme un r\u00eave d\u00e9crit par l'Erreur \u00e0 Ignace de Loyola. Cependant, ces pi\u00e8ces noires et blanches sont facilement identifiables, les cases g\u00e9om\u00e9triques toutes identiques forment en fait un paysage familier pour le spectateur de 1624. Si cr\u00e9ation originale il y a, c'est dans l'utilisation par Middleton comme sujet de sa pi\u00e8ce d'un mat\u00e9riau d'actualit\u00e9 qu'il fa\u00e7onne \u00e0 sa guise pour en faire un objet dramatique. Son jeu d'\u00e9checs est en quelque sorte l'\u00e9quivalent des \u00e9missions satiriques de la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision d'aujourd'hui, qui pr\u00e9sentent les hommes politiques, les c\u00e9l\u00e9brit\u00e9s, sous forme de marionnettes caricaturales. Dans certains cas, la cr\u00e9ation satirique donne un portrait tr\u00e8s juste de l'original : ainsi les Com\u00e9diens du Roi, qui jouent la pi\u00e8ce au Globe du 5 au 14 ao\u00fbt 1624, acqui\u00e8rent pour leur mise en sc\u00e8ne un habit ayant appartenu au Cavalier Noir, le comte Gondomar, ambassadeur d'Espagne \u00e0 la cour d'Angleterre de 1613 \u00e0 1622 ; mais aussi sa chaise \u00e0 porteurs -rendue c\u00e9l\u00e8bre par une s\u00e9rie d'accidents de la circulation dans les rues encombr\u00e9es de Londres -et la chaise perc\u00e9e qu'une fistule le for\u00e7ait \u00e0 utiliser. La plupart des autres pi\u00e8ces sont tout aussi faciles \u00e0 identifier \u00e0 de v\u00e9ritables acteurs de la vie politique : le Roi Blanc est bien s\u00fbr Jacques I er , la Tour, ou le Duc Blanc est le Duc de Buckingham, son favori, le Cavalier Blanc est le Prince Charles, le Roi Noir Philippe IV d'Espagne, le Fou Noir le P\u00e8re G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des J\u00e9suites, le Gros Fou, principal personnage comique de la pi\u00e8ce et victime, avec le Cavalier Noir, de la satire la plus f\u00e9roce ou la plus savoureuse, repr\u00e9sente, lui, Marc Antonio de Dominis, archev\u00eaque de Spalato -Raguse, ou Split -pr\u00e9lat catholique devenu anglican qui joissait d'une certaine influence aupr\u00e8s de Jacques I er avant de retourner \u00e0 Rome, o\u00f9 il meure dans les ge\u00f4les de l'Inquisition en septembre 1624, un mois apr\u00e8s le triomphe de la pi\u00e8ce. Le Pion du Roi Blanc, une pi\u00e8ce mineure qui a pourtant attir\u00e9 l'attention des spectateurs de 1624, repr\u00e9sente sans doute Lionel Cranfield, comte de Middlesex et Lord Treasurer, victime d'un impeachment (proc\u00e9dure de destitution) en mai 1624, deux mois avant la pi\u00e8ce, pour s'\u00eatre trop ouvertement oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e en guerre de l'Angleterre contre l'Espagne. D'autres pi\u00e8ces sont plus difficiles \u00e0 cerner, car elles ne correspondent pas \u00e0 un personnage historique mais \u00e0 une abstraction, ou incarnent une classe d'individus : ainsi la Reine Blanche et son Pion incarnent l'\u00c9glise d'Angleterre, le Pion du Fou Noir et le Pion de la Reine Noire sont des J\u00e9suites sans pour autant repr\u00e9senter l'un ou l'autre des nombreux martyres ou figures c\u00e9l\u00e8bres de la Compagnie de J\u00e9sus."

Using a fairly flexible functional form, the estimates show linear percent deterioration between age 35 and about age 70 and then quadratic deterioration after that. Chess shows much less deterioration than the physical activities. Deterioration rates are generally larger for the longer distances, and for swimming they are larger for women than for men. An advantage of using best-performance records to estimated deterioration rates is that they are generally based on very large samples. In addition, the age range is large. In this study the age range is 35-100 for swimming, 35-98 for track and field and running, and 35-94 for chess. The estimates also do not suffer from traditional forms of selection bias.",

A series of 12 games (6 white, 6 black) was played against PF2 using the best chess program that resulted from 50 generations of variation and selection in self-play. The results yielded 9 wins, 2 losses, and 1 draw for the evolved program. This paper reports on further evolution of the best-evolved chess program, executed through 7462 generations. Results show that the outcome of this subsequent evolution was statistically significantly better than the prior player from 50 generations. A 16-game series against PF2, which plays with the rating of a high-level master, resulted in 13 wins, 0 losses, and 3 draws, yielding a performance rating of approximately 2650.",

Chess is the Drosophila of AI, it was said, with reference to the fruit-fly whose fast reproductive cycle made it into a favorite test bed for genetic theories for almost a century. In this paper I will try to show Artificial Intelligence's relationship to games is quite different from what this analogy suggests. In fact, I will argue that AI is, at core, a theory of games and a theory of subjectivity as game-playing.",

To put it simply, Negamax tree searching implements the idea that \"The worse your opponent's best reply is, the better your move.\" Implementing this is surprisingly easy. It uses the fact that chess is a symmetric game, and that therefore the analysis function must give symmetric scoring. That is to say that at any point, the score for white is exactly minus the score for black, or equivalently the sum of the two scores always equals zero. This is quite straightforward to understand. If white is winning by one pawn, then clearly black is losing by the same amount. This principal can be extended to positional advantages, i.e. if white has doubled rooks on one file, then white has a bonus score, whereas black's position is weaker by the same amount because of this.",

To date, researchers have lacked convenient settings to collect participant data in order to gain insight into VCB governance and success factors. The present work addresses this gap by studying the Internet Chess Club, a successful business that offers a rich and accessible data source for the researcher.",

The strategy is clear: to leverage the ubiquitous reach and range of the Internet to locate and gather birds-of-a-feather interest groups, to provide these groups with convenient visual interface tools supporting asynchronous and synchronous group interaction, and to sit back and watch as the nascent groups commingle in a virtual melting pot and bootstrap themselves to a critical mass.

A weakness of typical paired comparison experimental designs is the di culty in incorporating prior information, which can be particularly relevant for the design of tournament schedules for players of games and sports. Pairing methods that make use of prior information are often ad hoc algorithms with little or no formal basis. The problem of pairing objects can be formalized as a Bayesian optimal design. Assuming a linear paired comparison model for outcomes, we develop a pairing method that maximizes the expected gain in Kullback-Leibler information from the prior to the posterior distribution. The optimal pairing is determined using a combinatorial optimization method commonly used in graph-theoretic contexts. We discuss the properties of our optimal pairing criterion, and demonstrate our method as an adaptive procedure for pairing objects multiple times. We compare the performance of our method on simulated data against random pairings, and against a system that is currently in use in tournament chess.",

This tendecy of computer play has been criticized since it differs much from emulating human thought which could be one of the primary goals of computer game playing. An alternative way which is much closer to human game playing, is to discover automatically rules for a given game with the aid of Artificial Intelligence techniques and human thought. The obtainment of these rules could not only serve to build computer game programs, but it could have a much broader scope: to understand better the ideas of a certain game, to investigate how to build automatically learnt policies for a planning problem, and perhaps even to understand a bit better human thinking. To illustrate things, we use a small game, that could be called King Race, and discover rules to solve it. To discover these rules we use some human thought and a decision tree program. Then we prove mathematically that these automatically obtained rules indeed solve the game. This rules can aid in building computer chess endings programs that do not use brutal force. We believe that these techniques could be used more often in many other more complex games with positive results and encourage to do so.",

In human practice, both elements (knowing the game and knowing the opponent) play an important role. This article focuses on opponent modelling independent of any game. So, the domain of interest is a collection of two-person games, multiperson games, and commercial games. The emphasis is on types and roles of opponent models, such as speculation, tutoring, training, and mimicking characters. Various implementations are given. Suggestions for learning the opponent models are described and their realization is illustrated by opponent models in game-tree search. We then transfer these techniques to commercial games. Here it is crucial for a successful opponent model that the changes of the opponent's reactions over time are adequately dealt with. This is done by dynamic scripting, an improvised online learning technique for games. Our conclusions are (1) that opponent modelling has a wealth of techniques that are waiting for implementation in actual commercial games, but (2) that the games' publishers are reluctant to incorporate these techniques since they have no definitive opinion on the successes of a program that is outclassing human beings in strength and creativity, and (3) that game AI has an entertainment factor that is too multifaceted to grasp in reasonable time.",

Consider the case where an iteration of \u03b1\u03b2 search comes across a position p that needs to be searched to depth d1, and the transposition table reveals that p will likely need to be searched later in that iteration to depth d2 greater than d1. Pre-searching involves speculatively searching p to depth d2, even though it has not been demonstrated that search to this depth is needed. If the gamble is successful, then additional accuracy is introduced to the search (using a result with extra search depth d2 -d1). While any search extension scheme is not without some risk, empirical results indicate that the impact on the \u03b1\u03b2 search tree size is small, but the additional accuracy that is introduced improves program performance.",

         "Abstract": "Rising population intelligence should be impacting in the real world and performance in intellectual games such as chess may be good indices of such impact. Previous research suggests that chess players recently have been reaching high performance levels at younger and younger ages, consistent with rising population ability, but this conclusion is based on very limited data. Sample size was small and data mostly were only from 1970. The present study was able to use all international chess rating list data and some new data back to 1880 to investigate this issue thoroughly. Longitudinal data show that the age effect really is something quite new, not being apparent before 1970. The age effect mostly is occurring in the very top players, who are getting on the list at progressively younger ages, but also is occurring in female players, though not as strongly. The age effect mainly seems due to progressively more very talented young players entering the rating list very young and quickly rising. The data also allow some other interpretations of the age effect to be partly excluded. Top players do not seem to be getting any more practice and the peak rating age still seems to be around 35 years old, as it has been for many decades. The effect thus is unlikely to be due to recent changes in the chess environment. The best interpretation is that the natural talent pool has greatly improved in recent years, consistent with rising population ability.",

         "Abstract": "Males traditionally predominate at upper achievement levels. One general view holds that this is due only to various social factors such as the 'glass ceiling' and lack of female role models. Another view holds that it occurs partly because of innate ability differences, with more males being at upper ability levels. In the last few decades, women have become more achievement focused and competitive and have gained many more opportunities to achieve. The present study examined one intellectual domain, international chess, to quantify its gender differences in achievement and to see if these have been diminishing with the societal changes. Chess is a good test domain because it is a meritocracy, it has objective performance measures, and longitudinal data of a whole population are available. Performance ratings overall and in the top 10, 50 and 100 players of each sex show large gender differences and little convergence over the past three decades, although a few females have become high achievers. The distribution of performance ratings on the January 2004 list shows a higher male mean and evidence for more male variation, just as with traits such as height. Career patterns of players first on the list between 1985 and 1989 show that top males and females entered the list at about the same age but females tend to play fewer games and have shorter careers. In this domain at least, the male predominance is large and has remained roughly constant despite societal changes.",

This paper describes a method to construct endgame databases that are formally verified to logically follow from the laws of chess. The method employs a theorem prover to model the laws of chess and ensure that the construction is correct, and also a BDD engine to compactly represent and calculate with large sets of chess positions. An implementation using the HOL4 theorem prover and the BuDDY BDD engine is able to solve all four piece pawnless endgames.",

ACE represents an alternative to manually constructed case bases and domain specific techniques, and is generally applicable to any domain for which knowledge can be obtained from a series of observations of an environment (e.g., checkers or massively multiplayer games). A priority is placed on maintaining the flexibility necessary to learn new domains with only negligible manual configuration. We found during testing that the current approach to ACE with a reliance on experience and exploration, while quite capable in the domain of checkers, did not perform adequately in the exponentially more complex domain of chess. Our results suggest that experience alone, without the ability to adapt for case differences between new and prior cases, is insufficient in more complex domains.",

We collected the top-5 ranked moves and their scores as reported by FRITZ and JUNIOR, after 15 and 30 minutes of thinking time, and the top-5 moves recorded in the POWERBOOK, for the Nunn2 test positions and the initial board position. The data analysis was carried out using several nonparametric measures, including the amount of overlap in the top-5 choices of the engines and their association as measured by three variants of Spearman's footrule. Our preliminary results show that, overall, the engines differ substantially in their choice of moves, and, furthermore, the engines' choices also differ substantially from human choice.",

The models were thus centered on an inference engine manipulating passive symbols in the form of tokens. It is beyond doubt, however, that human players do not carry out such processes. Instead, chess masters instead carry out perceptual processes, carefully categorizing the chunks perceived in a position and gradually building complex dynamic structures to represent the subtle pressures embedded in the positions. In this paper we will consider two hypotheses concerning the underlying subcognitive processes and architecture. In the first hypothesis, a multiple-leveled chess representational structure is presented, which includes distance graphs (with varying levels of quality) between pieces, piece mobilities, and abstract roles. These representational schemes seem to account for numerous characteristics of human player's psychology. The second hypothesis concerns the extension of the architecture proposed in the Copycat project as central for modeling the emergent intuitive perception of a chess position. We provide a synthesis on how the postulated architecture models chess intuition as an emergent mixture of simultaneous distance estimations, chunk perceptions, abstract role awareness, and intention activations. This is an alternative model to the traditional AI approaches, focusing on the philosophy of active symbols.",

         "Abstract": "For a long period of time, two person zero-sum games have been in the focus of researchers of various communities. The efforts were mainly driven by the fascination of special competitions like Deep Blue vs. Kasparov, and of the beauty of parlor games like Checkers, Backgammon, Othello and Go. Multi-player games, however, have been inspected by far less, and although literature of game theory fills books about equilibrium-strategies in such games, practical experiences are rare. Korf, Sturtevant and a few others started highly interesting research activities. We have started investigating a four-person chess variant, in order to understand the peculiarities of multi player games without chance components. In this contribution, we present player models and search algorithms that we tested in the four-player chess world. As a result, we can say that the more successful player models can benefit from more efficient algorithms and speed, because searching deeper leads to better results. Moreover, we present a meta-strategy, which beats a paranoid alphabeta player, the best known player in multi player games.",

         "Abstract": "In game-playing programs relying on the minimax principle, deeper searches generally produce better evaluations. Theoretical analyses, however, suggest that in many cases minimaxing amplifies the noise introduced by the heuristic function used to evaluate the leaves of the game tree, leading to what is known as pathological behavior, where deeper searches produce worse evaluations. In most of the previous research, positions were evaluated as losses or wins. Dependence between the values of positions close to each other was identified as the property of realistic game trees that eliminates the pathology and explains why minimax is successful in practice. In this paper we present an alternative explanation that does not rely on value dependence. We show that if real numbers are used for position values, position values tend to be further apart at lower levels of the game tree, which leads to a larger proportion of more extreme positions, where error is less probable. Decreased probability of error in searches to greater depths is sufficient to eliminate the pathology and no additional properties of game trees are required.",
         "Introduction": "Most game-playing programs are based on the minimax principle. Such programs choose the best move by searching the game tree to a chosen depth, heuristically evaluating the leaves and then propagating their values to the root using the minimax principle. It is generally agreed that deeper searches produce better evaluations at the root. However, first attempts to explain this mathematically yielded the paradoxical result that minimaxing amplifies the error of the heuristic evaluations and that consequently deeper searches produce worse evaluations "

From this point on it is easier to trace the development of the game through the centuries that followed, by examining records of individual changes to rules or game pieces. Since that time, the rules of Chess have been tinkered with regularly, and continue to be. In fact, with Chess computers changing how professionals view the game, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs (FIDE) has been changing (and unchanging) the rules of the game even within the last decade.",
         "Introduction": "It is difficult to put an age on the game of Chess. A game of such complexity cannot be dreamed up overnight; it must be developed over time. To put a birth date on chess is akin to putting a date on when in our evolution our race stopped being apes, and started being humans. To answer this second question, one would have to draw an arbitrary line between apes and humans so that a relatively precise date could be attached. The origin of Chess is stated with this analogy in mind. The first known form of chess is called Chaturanga, was devised in the Punjab and was played in India from around the middle of the Sixth Century A.D. Even dating as vaguely as this, one must be cautious; there is considerable controversy about many aspects of the historical evidence on which the claim is made "

         "Abstract": "Nowadays, designers of Virtual Reality (VR) applications are faced with the choice of a large number of different input and output devices leading to a growing number of interaction techniques. Usually VR interaction techniques are described informally, based on the actions users can perform within the VR environment. At implementation time, such informal descriptions (made at design time) yield to ambiguous interpretations by the developers. In addition, informal descriptions make it difficult to foresee the impact throughout the application of a modification of the interaction techniques. This paper discusses the advantages of using a formal description technique (called ICO) to model interaction techniques and dialogues for VR applications. This notation is presented via a case study featuring an immersive VR application. The case study is then used to show, through analysis of models, how the formal notation can help to ensure the usability, reliability and efficiency of virtual reality systems.",
         "Introduction": "Virtual reality (VR) applications feature specificities compared to classical WIMP (Window, Icon, Menu and Pointers) interactive systems. WIMP interfaces may be considered as static (as the number of interactive widgets is usually known beforehand). Besides, they provide users with simple interaction techniques based on the use of the keyboard and/or the mouse, and the events produced (click, double click, etc.) are easy to manage. On the contrary, VR systems are based on 3D representations with complex interaction techniques (usually multimodal) where inputs and outputs can be very complex to manage due to the number of potential devices (data gloves, eye trackers, 3D mouse or trackball, force-feedback devices, stereovision, etc.). Designing or implementing VR applications require to address several issues like immersion, 3D visualisation, handling of multiple input and output devices, complex dialogue design, etc."

La prima parte dell'attivit\u00e0 ha visto coinvolti i ragazzi della classe sperimentale nella costruzione di una scacchiera gigante formata da fogli di carta di quotidiani appositamente tagliati a quadrati ed uniti nel formare la scacchiera con dello scotch, mentre la classe di controllo ha acquisito i concetti base della scacchiera interagendo con il programma per p.c. S\u00ec \u00e8 poi passati alla conoscenza della disposizione delle pedine sulla scacchiera; il gruppo sperimentale ha impersonificato le pedine utilizzando un kit figurativo, mentre il gruppo -controllo ha interagito con il programma elettronico; alla fine di questa seconda attivit\u00e0 i ragazzi hanno svolto una verifica sulla conoscenza delle posizioni che ha avuto un esito simile in entrambi i gruppi. Successivamente si \u00e8 passati alla conoscenza degli spostamenti di ogni pedina e delle regole generali del gioco; anche in questo caso, i ragazzi del gruppo sperimentale hanno impersonificato le pedine muovendosi secondo le regole o secondo dei giochi propedeutici alla memorizzazione degli spostamenti ed il gruppo di controllo ha continuato ad interagire con il programma elettronico. Questa attivit\u00e0 ha comunque richiesto lo studio a casa di materiale didattico cartaceo che \u00e8 stato gentilmente fornito dal gruppo scacchi di Mantova . Dopo pochi giorni entrambe le classi hanno svolto una verifica sulla conoscenza delle regole di gioco che ha dato esiti molto simili e ha permesso di valutare che il livello di competenza fosse sufficiente per poter iniziare a giocare sulle scacchiere costruite nel frattempo dai ragazzi con del cartone tagliato a quadrato e appositamente colorato a scacchi. Per la costruzione delle pedine sono stati utilizzati dei tappi di bottiglia di varia forma e misura ricoperti poi con della carta su cui sono stati disegnati i loghi delle pedine. Ultimate le scacchiere, gli alunni hanno potuto finalmente confrontarsi nel gioco prima con i compagni di classe e poi in torneo con quelli della classe parallela. La classifica di questo torneo ha visto primeggiare un gruppo di ragazzi cinesi ed una buona percentuale di ragazze ed, anche in questo caso, risultati tra le classi sono stati omogenei . La fase di ricerca si \u00e8 conclusa con la compilazione di un test di gradimento dell'attivit\u00e0 proposta che ha dimostrato un indice di apprezzamento nettamente maggiore nella classe sperimentale che ha imparato con un coinvolgimento corporeo. I ragazzi hanno comunque continuato a giocare a scacchi durante la ricreazione tanto da invogliare alunni di altre classi a confrontarsi con loro nel gioco. Si \u00e8 cos\u00ec organizzato un torneo d'Istituto a cui hanno partecipato ben 22 ragazzi di varie classi e i migliori 12 hanno avuto accesso alla fase provinciale dei Giochi Sportivi Studenteschi. Nonostante l'elevato livello di gioco di quest'ultimo torneo, un gruppo misto per sesso e nazionalit\u00e0 rappresentante la scuola si \u00e8 comunque classificato 9\u00b0 su venti squadre. Anche se la mia conoscenza del gioco \u00e8 scarsa, ritengo comunque che l'esperienza abbia trasmesso ai ragazzi un imput positivo per approfondire gli scacchi soprattutto in quegli alunni che non hanno capacit\u00e0 motorie elevate e che grazie a questo gioco si sono sentiti valorizzare in Educazione Fisica alla pari degli altri compagni pi\u00f9 abili."

We show that statistical sampling approaches can be developed to do well in such games. We show that it is not necessary for the random sample to consist only of game boards that satisfy each and every one of a player's observations. In fact, we win 24% more often by beginning with such completely consistent boards and gradually switching (as the game progressed) to boards that are merely consistent with the latest observation. This surprising result is explained by noting that as the game progresses, a board that is consistent with the last move becomes more and more likely to be consistent with the entire set of observations, even if we have no idea what sequence of moves might have actually generated this board.",
         "Introduction": "One of the biggest difficulties in using game-tree search algorithms in imperfect-information games is that the game trees have huge branching factors. Usually the belief-state size (the number of current states that are consistent with everything a player knows about the game) is combinatorially large. Hence the number of moves that the opponent might be able to make, and the number of states that these moves might lead to, are also quite large."

         "Abstract": "This article presents the results of experiments designed to gain insight into the effect of the minimax algorithm on the error of a heuristic evaluation function. Two types of effect of minimax are considered: (a) evaluation accuracy (Are the minimax backed-up values more accurate than the heuristic values themselves?), and (b) decision accuracy (Are moves played by deeper minimax search better than those by shallower search?). The experiments were performed in the King-Rook-King (KRK) chess endgame and in randomly generated game trees. The results show that, counter-intuitively, evaluation accuracy may decline with search depth, whereas at the same time decision accuracy improves with depth. In the article, this is explained by the fact that minimax in combination with a noisy evaluation function introduces a bias into the backed-up evaluations, which masks the evaluation effectiveness of minimax, but this bias still permits decision accuracy to improve with depth. This observed behaviour of minimax in the KRK endgame is discussed in the light of previous studies of pathology in minimax. It is shown that explaining the behaviour of minimax in an actual chess endgame in terms of previously known results requires special care.",

         "Introduction": "Lewis Carroll's association with chess rests on the theme of Through the Looking-Glass, Alice's journey as a pawn across the chessboard eventually to become a Queen. The thirty-two pieces of a chess set are identified as 'Dramatis Personae' at the start of the book, and each of them has some part in the story, although 'Lily' is replaced by Alice as 'Lily's too young to play'. The story's link with chess is faulty in many ways, but these are explained if the story is considered as arising from introducing Alice and her sisters to chess pieces and what they are for. It is then natural to consider them as real, and for example, explains why the White Knight has such poor balance -a chess piece that is a knight is not designed to slide down pokers, or ride on a toy horse."

This paper has a twofold objective: first, to review our recent results of applying genetic programming in the domain of games; second, to formulate the merits of genetic programming in acting as a tool for developing strategies in general, and to discuss the possible design of a strategizing machine.",

By introducing hidden pieces into the game, we have been able to gauge the effect of uncertainty on playing strength. The addition of a hidden white piece led to white winning between 63%-89% of its games. The advantage gained from an invisible piece is dependent on both the type of piece that is hidden, and the search depth at which games are played. Greater search depths increase the value of hidden pieces, although diminishing returns were noted at increased depths. The advantage of a hidden piece is typically greater than the effect of an equivalent extra piece. In this sense, information superiority gained via stealth is a more powerful advantage than additional material. The results indicate that uncertainty arising from hidden pieces profoundly influences outcomes in the game of chess.",

Data were gathered from a sample of participants for whom approaches to risk were likely to vary (academics, chess players, firefighters, mountaineers and City traders). The results showed that participants could be categorised into two groups: those who were consistent in their risk preferences in three decision domains, and those who were inconsistent or domain-specific. The consistent group was significantly lower on neuroticism and higher on agreeableness and conscientiousness with a less variable approach to weighing up the costs and benefits of taking risks than the inconsistent group. The majority of the consistent group was risk averse.",

However, entertainment applications for this user group are still few. The EyeChess project described in this paper is a PC-based tutorial to assist novices in playing chess endgames. The player always starts first and has to checkmate the Black King in three moves. First, to make a move the player selects a piece and then its destination square. To indicate that some squares could be activated, while other ones were forbidden for selection, color highlighting was applied. A square with a green highlight indicated a valid action, and the red color denoted invalid action. There were three options to make a selection: blinking, eye gesture (i.e., gazing at off-screen targets), and dwell time. If the player does not know how to solve the task, or s/he plays by making mistakes, the tutorial provides a hint. This shows up a blinking green highlight when the gaze points at the right square. Preliminary evaluation of the system revealed that dwell time was the preferred selection technique. The participants reported that the game was fun and easy to play using this method. Meanwhile, both the blinking and eye gesture methods were characterized as quite fatiguing. The tutorial was rated helpful in guiding the decision-making process and training the novice users in gaze interaction.",

The same experimental setup was used to search, among others, a set of 4,500 positions, from the opening phase, to a depth of 18 plies. Our results showed that the chance of new best moves being discovered decreases exponentially when searching to higher depths, and decreases faster for positions closer to the end of the game. This contribution brings the understanding of deep-search behaviour and the prediction of performance a step further to completion.",

However, so far the precise relation between search depth and playing strength is not known, despite the rich history of research on this topic. Previous research on deep-search behaviour can be divided into two approaches: self play and go deep."

         "Introduction": "( por Mihai Suba) Empezar\u00e9 parafraseando la pregunta de introducci\u00f3n al libro \"Problemas de la Filosof\u00eda\" del gran cient\u00edfico, y bien aficionado al ajedrez, Bertrand Russell. \u00bfHay alg\u00fan conocimiento de ajedrez que sea tan cierto que ning\u00fan jugador razonable pueda dudar? Esa cuesti\u00f3n es de las mas dif\u00edciles que se pueden preguntar. Contestar, pero no de manera descuidada y dogm\u00e1tica, como en la vida ordinaria, o incluso en la mayor\u00eda de los libros, es tarea dif\u00edcil. La respuesta tiene que ser critica, .despu\u00e9s de explorar todo el enredo que nos provoca, y despu\u00e9s de darnos cuenta de la vaguedad y confusi\u00f3n que subrayan nuestras ideas ordinarias sobre el tablero. En el juego o ense\u00f1anza de cada d\u00eda suponemos de demasiadas cosas que, al escrutinio m\u00e1s cercano, conllevan tantas contradicciones que solo un esfuerzo mental serio nos permite saber que es lo que podemos opinar. Cuando se trata de lo que transmitimos a otros, es preciso m\u00e1s cuidado y responsabilidad todav\u00eda. Incluso la experiencia personal, que sin duda deber\u00eda servirnos para derivar alg\u00fan conocimiento, es muy posible que nos sirva cosas desde subjetivas hasta err\u00f3neas. Preguntar por ejemplo a Kasparov sobre la India de Rey, que tantos \u00e9xitos le proporcion\u00f3 , y os dir\u00e1 la maravillosa que es esta defensa, cuando en realidad, el motivo de su \u00e9xito con la India de Rey est\u00e1 en una preparaci\u00f3n casi exhaustiva, en su mejor entender de las posiciones resultantes y en su mayor habilidad t\u00e1ctica. En su carrera Garry abord\u00f3 muchas aperturas y variantes de dudosa construcci\u00f3n estrat\u00e9gica, les sac\u00f3 todo el zumo, luego, cuando la gente se hab\u00eda enterrado como combatirlas, les abandon\u00f3. Detr\u00e1s suya hay cohortes de jugadores defraudados que se preguntan porque pierden cuando juegan \u00abcomo Kasparov\u00bb. Dependiendo de la edad a la que aprendemos el ajedrez, de nuestra pasi\u00f3n, m\u00e1s o menos sin limites, para el juego y sobre todo del entorno ajedrec\u00edstico donde damos los primeros y los siguientes pasos hac\u00eda el dominio del juego, en nuestros ojos se filtran muchos instant\u00e1neos de posiciones. A nuestros o\u00eddos llegan muchas palabras de ajedrez, consideraciones y sentencias que pasan al nivel del involuntario y luego influyen nuestra reacci\u00f3n en el tablero, es decir nuestra manifestaci\u00f3n inintencional. Ya hab\u00e9is acertado a que me refiero -a lo que algunos llaman intuici\u00f3n ajedrec\u00edstica, otros ^llaman talento, otros llaman reflejo, etc. En una palabra es erudici\u00f3n pasada al subconsciente. Escuchad que dicen Alejandro Beliavsky y Adri\u00e1n Mikhalchishin en el libro \"Los secretos de la intuici\u00f3n ajedrec\u00edstica\": \u00abLa intuici\u00f3n es entral en todas las decisiones que tomamos en ajedrez; entender su papel vital es imprescindible para mejorar el juego. Los jugadores que intentan calcularlo todo est\u00e1n condenados a perder contra aquellos que utilizan arm\u00f3nicamente sus habilidades l\u00f3gicas y su intuici\u00f3n.\u00bb La intenci\u00f3n de los autores es de ofrecer prototipos de posiciones donde tenemos que contar m\u00e1s con la intuici\u00f3n y otros donde hay que ser m\u00e1s anal\u00edtico. Me parece que se oyen protestas, \u00bfQu\u00e9? \u00bfUsted no est\u00e1 convencido que la mayor\u00eda de las cosas que hacemos en el tablero y en la vida son inintencionales? \u00bfUsted qu\u00e9 piensa cuando va en bicicleta? Usted no piensa nada, solo est\u00e1 pedaleando. Si intenta escuchar mis consejos sobre como pedalear, girarlo frenar, mientras pedalea, usted puede acabar cay\u00e9ndose con la bicicleta. En una serie anglo-americana para ni\u00f1os, el detective Freddie estaba consultado por un \"ciempi\u00e9s por haber perdido la sincronizaci\u00f3n de sus no se cuantos pies. La respuesta fue \u00abni mirarlos ni pensar en ello\u00bb es decir dejar la sabidur\u00eda natural del cuerpo que se encargue de ello. Otro ejemplo de proceso que nos pasa cada d\u00eda y no es un producto de la voluntad es el sue\u00f1o. \u00bfO es que usted no duerme? No, no aqu\u00ed. Ya lo se que lo mejor que se puede hacer durante una conferencia es dormirse. Solo \u00abel enemigo de clase no duerme\u00bb, seg\u00fan Lenin. Total que muchas cosas est\u00e1n dentro de nosotros y no las podemos controlar bien. \u00a1Ojala! pod\u00edamos rebobinar toda la informaci\u00f3n acumulada por .el subconsciente y hacer las correcciones oportunas. El conocimiento que llamamos del tipo \u00abprocedural\u00bb como, por ejemplo, el necesario para dar mate con dos torres, con entrega de alfil en \u00abh7\u00bb, ir en bicicleta, conducir un coche o nadar parece que est\u00e1 all\u00ed en lo suyo. No vamos a insistir porque los procedimientos se comprueban f\u00e1cilmente si funcionan bien o no. lo suyo. No vamos a insistir porque los procedimientos se comprueban f\u00e1cilmente si funcionan bien o no. Pero hay otro tipo de conocimiento, el \u00abdeclarativo\u00bb, que adem\u00e1s de ser mucho m\u00e1s frecuente y menos comprobable, se pega tambi\u00e9n en el subconsciente. Aqu\u00ed est\u00e1 el problema. \u00bfComo se llama usted? Aunque soy GM, no pod\u00eda calcular su nombre. Me lo tiene que decir usted. Puede que es una informaci\u00f3n falsa si yo entend\u00ed mal o usted me minti\u00f3, pero yo no tengo m\u00e1s remedio que cre\u00e9rmelo. Esta informaci\u00f3n pasar\u00e1 a mi subconsciente, asociada con su aspecto. Si le veo jugando, puedo a\u00f1adir m\u00e1s a esta informaci\u00f3n incierta, por ejemplo: \u00abx\u00bb es un buen jugador. O no, seg\u00fan me parece. Este juicio, a base de poca prueba, a\u00f1adir\u00eda a mi conocimiento m\u00e1s in certitud todav\u00eda. Vamos a bajar ahora desde los cielos de la filosof\u00eda a lo m\u00e1s terrestre, pr\u00e1ctico e inmediato que nos interesa, al lenguaje ajedrec\u00edstico de cada d\u00eda. Este es \u00e9l que nos est\u00e1 proporcionando los milpi\u00e9s de nuestra sabidur\u00eda ajedrec\u00edstica y de nuestros desencantos. Al analizar un lenguaje evitando contradicciones, nos tenemos que situar fuera de \u00e9l seg\u00fan demostr\u00f3 el mismo Bertrand Russel. Suponemos que la siguiente discusi\u00f3n transcurre en un \u00abmeta-lenguaje ajedrec\u00edstico\u00bb. Nada m\u00e1s bajar de los c\u00edelos hay que subir otra vez. En ese \u00abmeta-lenguaje\u00bb el sentido de cada palabra o expresi\u00f3n se parece al lenguaje ajedrec\u00edstico ordinario, pero no tanto. A ver las reglas que aprenden los novatos en ajedrez sobre el manejo de la apertura: Salir siempre con el pe\u00f3n rey o dama. \u00a1Me parece bien aunque yo no lo hago \" Colocar las piezas para que act\u00faen hac\u00eda el centro. \u00a1Estupendo!. Sacar los caballos antes que los alfiles. \u00a1Hmmm! Enrocar cuanto antes. \u00bfHmmm? Luego se sigue con algo peor, un adoctrinamiento del tipo \u00abNENE CACA\u00bb: NO mover una pieza m\u00e1s de una vez. (\u00bfQu\u00e9 tal la Espa\u00f1ola, o peor todav\u00eda la Defensa Alekhine?) NO mover m\u00e1s de uno o dos peones. (Y contra India de Rey \u00bfqu\u00e9?) NO perder el tiempo con ataques sin fondo, tipo \u00abmate pastor\u00bb. (Entonces la jugada de Botvinnik en una variante de la Inglesa -Ataque Panov es err\u00f3nea.) NO dejar casillas d\u00e9biles que el otro puede dominar u ocupar con sus piezas. (\u00bfSveshnikov?) NO cambiar un alfil! por un caballo (Nimzoindia), NO crearse debilidades que puedan servir de marco de ataque. \u00c9sa \u00faltima a lo mejor quiere decir que no movamos ning\u00fan pe\u00f3n. \u00bfEs jugar al ajedrez muy distinto de lo de ir en bicicleta? Si ralentizas y tomas tu tiempo para \u00abpensar en ello\u00bb \u00bfacabar\u00e1s jugando mejor o cay\u00e9ndote con la bicicleta? Vamos a ver como jugamos al ajedrez, al menos as\u00ed lo veo yo y muchos m\u00e1s. Introspecci\u00f3n: Inspiro y expiro. Pongo en marcha el hipn\u00f3tico p\u00e9ndulo con un movimiento firme. Dejo las volutas de c\u00edrculos conc\u00e9ntricos de mi concentraci\u00f3n a apaciguarse en mi mente. Absorbo la posici\u00f3n y la posici\u00f3n me absorbe a mi. Me gasto una broma interiormente para arrancar mi adrenalina ajedrec\u00edstica y para desarmar al oponente. Estoy mirando el tablero y veo la posici\u00f3n en cuanto mejor me permite mi imaginaci\u00f3n visual. La \u00abinintencionalidad\u00bb toma el mando mientras yo estoy marcando la posici\u00f3n. Para marcar la posici\u00f3n estoy empleando todo lo que puedo ver y todo el ajedrez que conozco. Hago notas mentales o me acuerdo otras notas mentales hechas con anterioridad. Durante la partida, mi mente esta en dos modalidades mayores, llam\u00e9moslas \u00abreacionando\u00bb y \u00aboteando\u00bb. Si estoy en forma, mi temporiz\u00e1ci\u00f3n es correcta. Si mi temporiz\u00e1ci\u00f3n es correcta, el ritmo de \u00aboteando, reaccionando, oteando, reaccionando y oteando\u00bb encajan perfectamente en las ranuras de las dichas volutas de c\u00edrculos conc\u00e9ntricos de mi concentraci\u00f3n. Entonces me encuentro en la \"zona ajedrez\". \"Zona ajedrez\" es un estado \u00abinintencional\u00bb de atenci\u00f3n y energ\u00eda enfocados de tal forma para aumentar el rendimiento ajedrec\u00edstico. Es un estado \u00f3ptimo para discurrir ajedrez. En la \u00abzona ajedrez\u00bb todas las rendimiento ajedrec\u00edstico. Es un estado \u00f3ptimo para discurrir ajedrez. En la \u00abzona ajedrez\u00bb todas las funciones no esenciales de mi cuerpo se apagan. Pierdo la cuenta sobre la mayor\u00eda de las variables de entorno. Mi mente ejerce ciertas cosas cuando est\u00e1 reaccionando\u00bb y otras parecidas pero distintas cuando est\u00e1 \u00aboteando\u00bb.

In this paper we examine and compare three different methods for generating training games: (1) Learning by self-play, (2) Learning by playing against an expert program, and (3) Learning from viewing experts play against themselves. Although the third possibility generates highquality games from the start compared to initial random games generated by self-play, the drawback is that the learning program is never allowed to test moves which it prefers. We compared these three methods using temporal difference methods to learn the game of backgammon. For particular games such as draughts and chess, learning from a large database containing games played by human experts has as a large advantage that during the generation of (useful) training games, no expensive lookahead planning is necessary for move selection. Experimental results in this paper show how useful this method is for learning to play chess and draughts.",

Since Siguo game is imperfect information game that the player doesn't know the type of piece and strategy that opponent moves, to exactly guess type of opponent' piece is a very important parameter to evaluate the capability of Siguo game program. In this paper, we first construct a fuzzy type table by analyzing more than one thousand different embattle lineups (i.e. chess manuals) of Siguo game, and then we present a algorithm that updates type table by using information from opponent during playing game. The updating type of pieces algorithm is designed by considering the two strategies, i.e. optimism and pessimism based on the fuzzy notion. At last we give a method to guess the type of piece by using fuzzy type proximity relation between two neighboring pieces.",

The financial and research potentials of making games more appealing (or else more interesting) are more than impressive. Interactive and cooperative characters can generate more realism in games and satisfaction for the player. Moreover, on-line (while play) machine learning techniques are able to produce characters with intelligent capabilities useful to any game's context. On that basis, richer human-machine interaction through real-time entertainment, player and emotional modeling may provide means for effective adjustment of the non-player characters' behavior in order to obtain games of substantial entertainment. This paper introduces a research scheme for creating NPCs that generate entertaining games which is based interdisciplinary on the aforementioned areas of research and is foundationally supported by several pilot studies on testbed games. Previous work and recent results are presented within this framework.",

So, the domain of interest is a collection of two-person games, multiperson games, and commercial games. The emphasis is on types and roles of opponent models, such as speculation, tutoring, training, and mimicking characters. Various implementations are given. Suggestions for learning the opponent models are described and their realization is illustrated by opponent models in game-tree search. We then transfer these techniques to commercial games. Here it is crucial for a successful opponent model that the changes of the opponent's reactions over time are adequately dealt with. This is done by dynamic scripting, an improvised online learning technique for games. Our conclusions are (1) that opponent modelling has a wealth of techniques that are waiting for implementation in actual commercial games, but (2) that the games' publishers are reluctant to incorporate these techniques since they have no definitive opinion on the successes of a program that is outclassing human beings in strength and creativity, and (3) that game AI has an entertainment factor that is too multifaceted to grasp in reasonable time.",

The training examples, used as input to the learning algorithm, describe specific descriptions of a number of solved instances in one domain; then to improve the learnt policies obtained from the training examples, the policies should evolve.

Using whole-head magnetoencephalography, we recorded focal bursts of GBA during chess playing. Unlike highly skilled chess grandmasters, with amateur chess players focal gamma bursts prevailed in deeper structures in the region of the medial temporal lobes. This observation is consistent with the interpretation of memory formation in amateur chess players. For the frontal and parietal cortex the relationship was reversed, with more frequent gamma bursts found in chess grandmasters, indicating that the retrieval of chunks from expert memory is based on the recruitment of these neocortical areas. The results suggest the possibility that time-dependent reorganization during the formation of expert memory can be studied in humans and support the theory that the medial temporal lobe and hippocampal formation play a transitional role during the creation of expert memory in the neocortex.",

Chess problems, for instance, are used in order to introduce elements of logic and (if presented in an adequate manner) to develop lateral thinking. The chessboard is a representation of the Cartesian plane, while the equation of a straight line and its slope are introduced by means of the movement of pieces. The chessboard and the pieces (its 'residents') are also suitable for topological considerations on the properties of topological spaces.

         "Introduction": "La matematica costituisce un mondo affascinante che pu\u00f2 essere avvicinato e apprezzato sin dalla giovane et\u00e0, soprattutto se presentato in maniera divertente, mettendone in risalto non tanto i formalismi, quanto le idee e gli aspetti creativi, stimolando la curiosit\u00e0 e l'apprendimento. II gioco rappresenta in tal senso uno strumento ideale e numerose idee matematiche si prestano ad essere proposte sotto forma di gioco: la matematica cosiddetta dilettevole, che ha appassionato nei secoli studiosi e profani, \u00e8 un modo efficace per avvicinarsi con spirito creativo a concetti e problemi tutt'altro che banali. In tale contesto il gioco degli scacchi assume un ruolo di primaria importanza. La sua complessit\u00e0 strutturale e ricchezza intrinseca, infatti, ne fanno un mondo per certi aspetti assimilabile a quello matematico, tant'\u00e8 che i legami tra matematica e scacchi sono da sempre materia di studio a partire da temi elementari e fantasiosi (come quello dei chicchi di grano da disporre in una successione determinata sulla scacchiera per ricompensare il leggendario inventore del gioco ), fino ad arrivare ad argomenti pi\u00f9 concreti e complessi, come i problemi classici, tra cui il celeberrimo 'salto di cavallo', affrontati da grandi matematici come Eulero. Lo svolgersi stesso della partita ha qualcosa in comune con l'esperienza dello studio matematico: nella fase di apertura il giocatore utilizza tra le sue conoscenze di teoria quelle necessarie ad impostare correttamente un particolare tipo di gioco, cos\u00ec come il matematico, affronta un problema dapprima attingendo dal proprio sapere quei particolari strumenti che occorrono nello specifico. Inquadrare nell'evolversi un'apertura \u00e8 come sviscerare una questione matematica nei suoi vari aspetti. Nel centro partita la creativit\u00e0 e l'intuizione si fondono con le capacit\u00e0 logiche necessarie per 'vedere' una situazione in evoluzione, cos\u00ec come la scoperta matematica necessita di un coinvolgimento totale delle diverse capacit\u00e0 umane allo scopo di trovare un collegamento prima sconosciuto. II finale \u00e8 la parte metodica della partita; \u00e8 l'unica fase completamente teorizzabile: nelle varie circostanze si riesce a determinare il vincitore e in linea di principio il procedimento che porta alla vittoria. E' cos\u00ec anche in matematica ove, giunti in certe situazioni o scritte certe equazioni, si sa che il problema pu\u00f2 essere portato a completa risoluzione utilizzando tecniche note. Ancor pi\u00f9 della partita il problema di scacchi \u00e8 simile ad un problema matematico: alle considerazioni precedenti, nella sostanza ancor valide, si aggiunge la coincidenza degli scopi (ora in entrambi i casi c'\u00e8 un problema da risolvere) e della fase di impostazione: la formulazione del problema \u00e8 univoca e rigorosa e occorre intraprendere il ragionamento studiando le propriet\u00e0. In definitiva si direbbe che le qualit\u00e0 del bravo scacchista sono le stesse caratterizzanti il buon matematico. G.H.Hardy ha scritto nella sua 'Apologia di un matematico': \u00abOgni paese civile conta innumerevoli giocatori di scacchi (in Russia quasi tutte le persone colte giocano a scacchi), che sanno apprezzare la 'bellezza' del gioco o di un problema."

Although it is a two-person game it needs a referee, whose task consists in accepting the legal moves and rejecting the illegal ones, with respect to the real situation.

         "Introduction": "Kriegspiel is a chess variant similar to wargames, in which players have to deal with uncertainty. All chess rules are valid, but the players are not informed of their opponent's moves. Although it is a two-person game, it needs a referee, whose task consists in accepting the legal moves and rejecting the illegal ones, with respect to the real situation. As the game progresses, each player tries to guess the position of his opponent's pieces by trying moves to which the referee can stay silent, if the move is legal, or can state \"illegal move\", if the move is illegal. Then the player has to try again. If the move is legal and it gives check or captures a piece, the referee says \"check\" or \"capture\", respectively. In order to speed up the game if a Pawn can capture an opponent's piece this is also announced. For instance, here is a simple game (we omit illegal tries): 1. e4 f6 -the referee stays silent (both moves are legal); 2. e5 -the referee announces: \"Black has a Pawn try\"; 2. ..fe5 -the referee says \"Pawn captured on e5\"; 3. \u00c9h5 -the referee announces: \"Check on short diagonal\" (see Figure "

The gesture, speech and multimodal behaviours of 20 subjects are detailed. The multimodal oral with gesture large display interface (MOWGLI) is then described. It is an oral and gesture multimodal human-computer interface, allowing users interacting remotely in real time. Continuous pointing direction and other hand discrete selection gestures are recognized by computer vision tracking of user's head and hands. Associating gesture recognition with speech recognition of selection and deselection oral commands, MOWGLI behaves as a virtual contactless, application independent, multimodal mouse. Discrete pointing locations corresponding to discrete speech or gesture selection time events are extracted from the continuous pointing process. A large vocabulary related to a chess game application allows shorter and specific multimodal commands such as pointing at desired location htherei and uttering a piece move oral command without needing a previous pointing gesture to another piece location, whereas generic ''Put that there'' commands need two successive pointing locations (hthati and htherei). Contextual constraints such as displacement rules of pieces and current game position allow interpretation of ambiguous commands and lead to shorter multimodal commands.",

One important experimental hotbed of various search algorithms has been in the field of game playing, in which game-tree search is widely used to find the best moves for twoplayer games. Computer programs based on advanced search algorithms and general purpose processors have achieved great success in popular games such as checkers, Othello and chess.",

In this model, leaf selections and score updates are completely serialized, but tree updates involve no communication. The serialization does not hurt performance in practice, as long as leaf expansion is significantly more expensive than selecting leaves and backing up scores. The maximum number of processors that this implementation can use depends on the cost of leaf evaluation relative to the cost of tree updates and leaf selections."

For example, if a child who is fascinated with dinosaurs and has learned a lot about them correctly infers attributes about some dinosaurs that was new to them by reasoning analogically to some known dinosaurs (e.g., the shape of teeth for carnivores versus vegetarians), we would not conclude that the \"expert\" child has a more powerful analogical reasoning strategy. Instead, we would conclude that such a global or domain-general reasoning strategy is available to all children, but that novice children might reason analogically to some other familiar domain, such as animals (rather than dinosaurs), as our data have shown "

         "Introduction": "On the basis of recently (re)discovered documents, the paper discusses the family tree of the Jewish Lasker dynasty, originating from Lask in Poland, formerly Prussia. The common forefather of all Laskers was Rabbi Meier Hindels, who lived around 1700. In Germany, the most successful of his descendants was Dr. Eduard Lasker (1829-1884). He was a lawyer, co-founder of the National Liberal party, and in his lifetime the most conspicuous parliamentary opponent to Reich Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. Germany owes him a considerable part of its present day legal structures in criminal, civil and public law. His younger brother Moritz/Morris (1840-1916) settled in Texas and became a prominent figure both in business and society. The Lasker family branch that he established in the United States is still flourishing today and has produced a number of personalities of public renown. While visiting his brother, Eduard Lasker died in New York in January 1884. Edward Lasker (1885-1981), a prominent US-based chess champion, descended from another family branch. One of his nieces, Anita Wallfisch-Lasker, wrote an autobiography that describes her ordeal as a member of the camp orchestra at Auschwitz. mentarier der Bismarck-Zeit. Emanuel Lasker (24. Dezember 1868 bis  1941), der einzige deutsche Schachweltmeister (Titeltr\u00e4ger von 1894 bis 1921), Freund Einsteins und Erlanger Doktorand der Mathematik, h\u00e4lt sich erstaunlich hartn\u00e4ckig im kollektiven Ged\u00e4chtnis der Deutschen, obwohl er doch 1937 emigrieren mu\u00dfte, ihm 1938 die deutsche Staatsb\u00fcrgerschaft aberkannt wurde und er 1941 in den USA verstarb. Ich verwende f\u00fcr ihn durchgehend weiterhin den Vornamen Emanuel, wie so gut wie alle Publikationen \u00fcber ihn, obwohl er nach seiner Geburtsurkunde als Immanuel getauft wurde. "

Interestingly, it is this opening phase which causes most problems for the computers. Not because they do not understand openings in general, but because the opening books contain too much rubbish.

An advantage of using best-performance records to estimate rates of decline is that the records are generally based on very large samples. In addition, the age range is large. In this study the age range is 35-100 for swimming, 35-98 for track and field and running, and 35-94 for chess. The estimates also do not suffer from traditional forms of selection bias.",

The experiments carried out by Beal and Smith, using random minimaxing in Chess, showed that the strength of play increases as the depth of the lookahead is increased. In previous research [LF01] we provided a partial explanation of why random minimaxing can strengthen play by showing that when one move dominates another move, i.e. when white has at least as many moves as black to chose from when it is his move and black has no more moves to chose from than white when it his move, then this dominating move is more likely to be chosen by minimax. This paper solves a special case of determining the move probability when domination does not occur. Specifically we show that, under the uniform branching game tree model, whether the probability of a move is greater than another depends, not only on the branching factors of the moves involved, but also on whether the number of ply searched is odd or even. This is a new manifestation of game tree pathology, where the minimax procedure will change its mind as to which move is best independently of the true value of the game, and oscillate between moves as the depth alternates between odd and even.",
         "Introduction": "The minimax procedure is the fundamental search algorithm for deciding the next move to play in two-player perfect information games between white and black [Sha50, Kai90, MB00]; Chess, Checkers, Othello and Go are examples of such games. The minimax procedure is utilised by constructing a full-width \u03b4-ply game tree (with \u03b4 \u2265 1) from the current position (with white to move), where nodes represent game positions and arcs represent legal moves from one position to another. The value of the root is determined by computing a score for each leaf value using a static evaluation function and backing up these scores using the minimax rule. In practice many refinements have been developed in order to improve the efficiency and depth of search of the minimax search algorithm "

The resultant program, named Blondie25, did not use any rules for managing the time allocated per move; it simply used three minutes on each move. Heuristics to more effectively manage time were developed by trial and error, play testing against Fritz 8.0. The best heuristics discovered were different for black and white. The results of 12 games played on each side were 1 win, 4 losses, and 7 draws for black, and 2 wins, 6 losses, and 4 draws for white. Fritz 8.0 is rated currently at 2752 (\u00b120) on SSDF (the acronym for the Swedish Chess Computer Association), placing it as the 12 th strongest program in the world. At the time of the contest between Blondie25 and Fritz 8.0, Fritz 8.0 was rated #5 in the world. The results are the first case of an evolved chess program defeating a world-class chess program (three times). The performance rating for Blondie25 against Fritz 8.0 was 2635.33, which compares well with the previous performance rating of 2650 against Pocket Fritz 2.0. Blondie25 was then tested against a nationally ranked human chess master, rated 2301. In four games, Blondie25 won three and lost one.",

If the sum is 0, you better be a gentle(wo)man and offer your opponent to move first, because you can win as second player. If the sum is nonzero you can move first and make it 0, thus winning."

This tendency of computer play has been criticized since it differs much from emulating human thoughts which once was one of the primary goals of computer game playing. An alternative way which is much closer to human game playing, is to discover rules automatically for a given game with the aid of Artificial-Intelligence techniques and human thought. Obtaining such rules can be done by building computer game programs. This research line may have a much broader scope (1) to understand better the ideas of a certain game, (2) to investigate how to build automatically learnt policies for a planning problem, and perhaps even (3) to understand a bit better human thinking. To illustrate these three points, we use a small game, that could be called King Race, and we aim at discovering rules to solve it. To discover these rules we use some human thought and a decision tree program. Then we prove mathematically that these automatically obtained rules indeed solve the game. The rules can aid in building computer-chess endgame programs that do not use brute force.",

Sometimes it chooses a slightly inferior move, if there is an indication that the opponent may fall into a trap, and if the potential profit is high. The algorithm was implemented in an Othello program named Desdemona, and tested against both computer and human opponents. Desdemona achieved a higher rating against human opposition on Yahoo! Games when using the trappy algorithm than when it used standard minimax.",
         "Introduction": "Minimax is a well-known algorithm for performing adversarial search in two-player strategy games. Although it is known to work very well in practice, it also has its shortcomings. One of these is that it assumes best play by the opponent. Often, a human (or even a computer) may be fallible, and may be tricked into playing an inferior move. Minimax never takes this into account, and thus it never purposefully tries to set traps."

In exploring its neurophysiological basis, recent research has provided considerable evidence of the neural efficiency hypothesis of intelligence, indicating lower and more focussed brain activation in brighter individuals. The present EEG study investigates the impacts of intelligence and expertise on cognitive performance and the accompanying cortical activation patterns in the domain of tournament chess. Forty-seven tournament chess players of varying intelligence and expertise level worked on tasks drawing on mental speed, memory, and reasoning. Half of the tasks were representative for chess, while the other half was not. The cortical activation was quantified by means of event-related desynchronisation (ERD) in the upper alpha band. Independent effects of expertise and intelligence emerged at both, the performance and the neurophysiological level. Brighter participants performed better than less intelligent ones which was associated with more efficient brain functioning (lower ERD) across all tasks. Additionally, a high expertise level was beneficial for good task performance but exerted a topographically differentiated influence on the cortical activation patterns. The findings suggest that superior cognitive performance and the underlying cortical activation are not only a function of knowledge and domain-specific competences but also of the general efficiency of the information processing system.",

A sample of 90 adult tournament chess players of varying playing strengths (1311-2387 ELO) was screened with tests on intelligence and personality variables; in addition, experience in chess play, tournament participation, and practice activities were assessed. Correlation and regression analyses revealed a clear-cut moderate relationship between general (and in particular numerical) intelligence and the participants' playing strengths, suggesting that expert chess play does not stand in isolation from superior mental abilities. The strongest predictor of the attained expertise level, however, was the participants' chess experience which highlights the relevance of long-term engagement for the development of expertise. Among all analysed personality dimensions, only domain-speciWc performance motivation and emotion expression control incrementally contributed to the prediction of playing strength. In total, measures of chess experience, current tournament activity, intelligence, and personality accounted for about 55% of variance in chess expertise. The present results suggest that individual diVerences in chess expertise are multifaceted and cannot be reduced to diVerences in domain experience.",

         "Introduction": "In the John Cage Music Manuscript Collection of The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts there is a folder of 13 pages of handwritten music (plus one cover page) by John Cage that contains a work titled Chess Pieces (call number: JPB 95-3 Folder 109). This work (which might be for piano) appears to be of the form: aabbddeefga agfeeddbbaa. Note that the form of the second half of the piece is a mirror image of the first half. Eleven 12-bar sections have been written. Perhaps these eleven sections are to be used as the eleven sections of the first half of the piece. Mirror images are also used for smaller structures. For example, the 12 bars of the first two \"a\" sections are grouped as 3 bars, followed by 4 bars, followed by 5 bars (i.e. 12=3+4+5). The 12 bars of the first \"b\" section are grouped as 5 bars, followed by 4 bars, followed by 3 bars (i.e. 12=5+4+3). This piece may be unfinished. It is unclear whether or not Cage intended to write eleven more sections for the second half of the piece or if the eleven sections that have been written are to be played in reverse order for the second half."

         "Abstract": "In theory, the values of terminal positions of a game are determined by the rules of the game, and the values of non-terminal positions are determined by minimax. The so-obtained backed-up values respect the minimax relation. In the practice of computer game playing, heuristic evaluation function is applied to terminal positions of the search tree, and the heuristic evaluations of non-terminal positions are obtained by minimax. It is understood that the heuristic evaluation function approximates some unknown \"true values\", or \"ideal\" heuristic values. In this paper, we investigate what should be the properties of such \"true values\" to be useful for enabling direction-oriented play toward winning in a won position. We point out that static heuristic values should not respect the minimax relation, and that it is useful if they are monotonically related to distance to win. We show experimentally that the evaluation function used in the Crafty program, as a typical representative of chess evaluation functions, tends to have these properties.",
         "Introduction": "The minimax principle is applied in game playing as follows. The terminal positions of a game are assigned values according to the rules of the game. If the game ends in such a terminal position, this value is the final result of the game, that is, this value is the score obtained by the players. The rules of the game do not define the values of non-terminal positions. These values can be determined by back-propagation from terminal positions and applying the minimax rule. So the value of a non-terminal position P is equal to the score of the terminal position of the game that starts in P and is played optimally by both players. An optimal play (principle variation) from position P is, accordingly, a sequence of moves that do not change the value of the positions along this sequence. So the property of a principle variation is that it preserves the value of the game."

We restrict ourselves to the problem that determinism seems to allow only an illusion of freedom but random decissions do not contain any freedom either. We show that this is a problem of natural sciences, not philosophy. Physics motivates replacing determinism by the principle of weak causality and introducing the concept of liberty. Its empirical basis remains untouched, but the theoretical interpretations of the state space in Newton theory and of the space-time in general relativity are changed. The emerging understanding of time agrees with the idea suggested once by Popper. In biology, the most important liberties are those of mutation, of motion and of the portable neural representation. We distinguish freedom and liberty. Each freedom is associated with some liberty and is defined as the ability to perform three processes called realization, selection and use of memory. This makes freedom accessible to experimental study. The freedom of will is explained by giving account of the underlying specific liberty and processes. While the realization has an ample space for randomness, the selection is mostly causal. Thus, determinism can be rejected without forcing decissions to be random. The experiments of Libet and the role of consciousness are discussed.",

         "Abstract": "reating a computer that can best humans in intellectual tasks has fascinated computer scientists and laymen alike since Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen created the Turk, a machine that seemed to play chess, in 1769. It took more than 200 years before a real machine, Deep Blue, 1 bested Gary Kasparov, the world chess champion and strongest human chess player at the time, with a score of 3.5 to 2.5 in a US$1.1 million match in 1997. 2   Deep Blue achieved this feat by using a combination of 480 special-purpose chess chips and a general-purpose supercomputer. The supercomputer, however, wasn't the main source of computational power. In fact, a four-way symmetric multiprocessing PC probably would have worked equally well as the host for the chess chips. This article concentrates on the Deep Blue chess chips used in the 1997 match, with an emphasis on what alternatives are plausible now, eight years later. This review is partially based on a 1999 IEEE Micro article. 3",
         "Introduction": "first grandmaster-level chess machine in 1988. The next major hardware advance came when Deep Blue lost its debut match to Kasparov in 1996, using a new chess chip based on 0.6-micron complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. In 1997, a revised version of the chip helped Deep Blue turn the tables and score its historic win over Kasparov. In 1999, I licensed the chip design before leaving my then employer, with the intent of creating a more advanced version of the chess chips using 0.18-micron technology. With this technology, a single chip could be almost as powerful as all of Deep Blue; a PC-based machine with a small number of new chess chips would have been able to give Kasparov hefty time odds (with the computer and Kasparov spending 5 seconds and 3 minutes on average per move, respectively) and yet play better than Deep Blue. Unfortunately, it wasn't possible to discover whether this would indeed be the case be-cause no agreement ever materialized, and I moved on to life beyond computer chess."

It is clearly vital that this data is correct and seen to be correct. This topic of data assurance is addressed in two ways here. First, the intrinsic challenges and complexity of creating endgame data by imperative programming are surveyed by noting errors managed during work in progress or surfacing in publications. Secondly, an approach through logic programming-new in this field-is introduced, and its contribution to data assurance is assessed. This translates the FIDE Articles definition of chess into higher order logic and then uses the HOL4 theorem prover and the BuDDy BDD engine to produce endgame data by deducing logical proofs of the theoretic value of endgame positions.",

Much of the research with regard to chess however, has been towards making machines play better and to understand how humans think. This article explores the principles of chess aesthetics and proposes a computational model based on those principles. An experiment was carried out comparing composed chess problems to over-the-board games. The results suggest that the model can discern between the beauty in chess problems where aesthetics is more prominent and over-the-board games where it is not. Implementation of the model into a computer program could therefore lead to the automatic detection of aesthetic mating combinations in chess that will be of interest to humans, particularly chess players and problem composers.",

         "Abstract": "In the past, there have been numerous studies into the cognitive processes involved in human problem solving. From the start, games and game theory have played an important role in the study of human problem solving behavior. In Chess, several cognitive experiments have been performed and those experiments have shown that expert chess players can memorize positions very quickly and accurately. Chase and Simon introduced the concept of chunking to explain why expert chess players perform so well in memory tasks. Chunking is the process of dividing a chess position into smaller parts that have meaning. We performed similar experiments in Shogi with a set of next-move problem positions, collecting verbal protocol data and eye-movement data. Even though experiments in Chess indicated that expert chess players searched as wide and deep as non-expert players, our experiments show that expert Shogi players search more moves, search deeper and search faster than non-expert players. Our experiments also show that expert Shogi players cannot only memorize the patterns of the positions but also recognize move sequences before and after the position. The results suggest that other than the perceptual spatial chunks introduced in chess research, there are also chunks of meaningful move sequences. We call such chunks \"temporal chunk\". Our research indicates that Shogi players become stronger by acquiring these temporal chunks.",

Three phenomena, which very clearly show the embodiment of the natural attitude and its resistance to the requirements of dance, are analyzed. The 'controlling gaze' is the natural tendency to look at the limbs and follow their movements instead of proprioceptive control. The 'chess play' is a natural tendency of moving on the flat surface and ignoring the volume of movement. The 'seduction' is a natural tendency to lose the body-self because of an interference with the other's body. The dancing body has constantly to deal with these natural inclinations. And a dance teacher has to understand this split between 'ought' and 'is'.   The basis of concrete movements is a given world, and the basis of abstract movements is created."

Like chess, this game is computationally challenging due to an extremely large strategy space. From the perspective of game theory, it is more interesting than chess because it has more than 2 players. Removing the 2-player restriction allows multiple equilibria and other complex strategic interactions that require the full tool set of game theory. The major challenge for applying game theoretic methods to such a large game is to identify a tractable subset of the game for detailed analysis that captures the essence of the strategic interactions. We argue that the notion of strategic independence holds significant promise for scaling game theory to large games. We present preliminary results based on data from two sets of strategies for chaturanga. These results suggest that strategic independence is present in chaturanga, and demonstrate some possible ways to exploit it.",
         "Introduction": "For many real games of interest, the underlying game form is not directly known by the players and/or analyst. Instead, various kinds of evidence may be available for estimating the game (for example, simulation). We refer to techniques for analyzing such games as empirical game theory. A distinguishing feature of empirical game theory is the direct emphasis on the process of discovering the parameters of the game. This is distinct from learning about opponents' strategies during repeated interactions, though the two types of learning are sometimes conflated. These scenarios can be modeled as games of incomplete information with uncertain payoffs "

         "Introduction": "Quando i computer giocano a scacchi I n Italia si disputa ogni anno il CIPS (Campionato Italiano per Programmi Scacchistici) che nel 2005 \u00e8 arrivato alla sua quinta edizione. Partecipano a questa manifestazione i principali motori italiani (che attualmente sono pi\u00f9 di 30) sviluppati nei pi\u00f9 disparati linguaggi di programmazione (C/C++, Delphi, Visual Basic e Java). Generalmente, le partite si disputano con un'ora a testa di riflessione (60 minuti) pi\u00f9 10 secondi di bonus per mossa (modalit\u00e0 Fisher). I contendenti sono uno di fronte all'altro, ciascuno con il proprio computer (la scelta della piattaforma hardware \u00e8 in genere libera) e interposta tra i due vi \u00e8 una scacchiera \"reale\" che riflette le mosse dei due giocatori. I turni di gioco sono generalmente organizzati secondo il sistema svizzero cio\u00e8, un sistema che permette di disputare un torneo, quando si \u00e8 alla presenza di parecchi giocatori e con poco tempo a disposizione (in genere un paio di giornate). Chi vince passa virtualmente il turno e si incontra con un altro giocatore vincente; chi perde invece continua a giocare e pu\u00f2 rifarsi nella partita successiva. Al turno successivo inoltre, chi ha giocato con il bianco giocher\u00e0 con il nero e viceversa. Il numero dei turni deve essere scelto in maniera tale da permettere la cosiddetta forma a piramide dove al vertice dovr\u00e0 esserci il giocatore che ha realizzato pi\u00f9 punti degli altri. La formula da utilizzare deve essere questa: se N \u00e8 il numero di giocatori e T il numero di turni, allora N deve essere inferiore o uguale a 2 elevato a T. Il numero di turni pu\u00f2 cos\u00ec essere inferiore al numero di giocatori con grande risparmio di tempo. Il sistema svizzero prevede di accoppiare tra loro i giocatori di pari punteggio, quando i partecipanti sono in numero pari, altrimenti, in caso di numero dispari uno di loro denominato \"Floater\" dovr\u00e0 essere necessariamente abbinato ad un giocatore con punteggio inferiore. Sempre nel 2005 si \u00e8 svolta a Bologna la CCC (Computer Chess Cup), una manifestazione preolimpica che ha visto la partecipazione di numerosi motori di gioco italiani, in vista dell'evento del 2006, le olimpiadi scacchistiche di Torino, una manifestazione che comprende tra l'altro il famoso World Computer Chess Championship (WCCC) arrivata quest'anno alla 14\u00b0 edizione e che vede la partecipazione dei \"guru\" di fama mondiale riguardo alla programmazione scacchistica. Le partite del 14\u00b0 WCCC sono suddivise su 11 turni secondo il sistema Svizzero e il tempo a disposizione per ciascun giocatore \u00e8 60 mosse in 120 minuti (X mosse in X minuti). Anche in questo caso i due contendenti utilizzeranno una scacchiera per giocare la mossa elaborata dal proprio programma. Ogni partita sar\u00e0 seguita da un arbitro che verificher\u00e0 la correttezza delle mosse giocate ed eventuali reclami (richiesta di patta per Threefold Repetition, illegal move ecc\u2026). Se un operatore inserisce per errore una mossa sbagliata \u00e8 possibile, dietro consenso dell'arbitro del torneo, fare un \"takeback\" della mossa (se il proprio programma lo consente) e giocare la mossa corretta. In questo caso gli orologi dei due contendenti verranno anch'essi aggiornati e sincronizzati."

As a fast-paced adversarial game, many challenges relevant to real-word application arise which give it merit for study and use. 15.",

For chess, which has a very rich opening theory, large databases of highquality games can be used as the basis of an opening book, from which statistics relating to move choices from given positions can be collected. In order to find out whether the opening books used by modern chess engines in machine versus machine competitions are \"comparable\" to those used by chess players in human versus human competitions, we carried out analysis on 26 test positions using statistics from two opening books one compiled from humans' games and the other from machines' games. Our analysis using several nonparametric measures, shows that, overall, there is a strong association between humans' and machines' choices of opening moves when using a book to guide their choices.",

         "Abstract": "Forward pruning, or selectively searching a subset of moves, is now commonly used in game-playing programs to reduce the number of nodes searched with manageable risk. Forward pruning techniques should consider how pruning errors in a game-tree search propagate to the root to minimize the risk of making errors. In this paper, we explore forward pruning using theoretical analyses and Monte Carlo simulations and report on two findings. Firstly, we find that pruning errors propagate differently depending on the player to move, and show that pruning errors on the opponent's moves are potentially more serious than pruning errors on the player's own moves. This suggests that pruning on the player's own move can be performed more aggressively compared to pruning on the opponent's move. Secondly, we examine the ability of the minimax search to filter away pruning errors and give bounds on the rate of error propagation to the root. We find that if the rate of pruning error is kept constant, the growth of errors with the depth of the tree dominates the filtering effect, therefore suggesting that pruning should be done more aggressively near the root and less aggressively near the leaves.",

         "Introduction": "Back in the early 1990's, a partial solution was reached by the legendary Ken Thompson of Bell Labs. He created a set of endgame databases which chess engines could use to provide them with \"technique\" in simple endgames. Here's an example. Let's say that a chess program has the \"won endgame\" of King + Rook vs. lone King. This is a pretty simple endgame, but there are a couple of possible pitfalls (as anyone who remembers learning the endgame will tell you). The technique is pretty straightforward: \"box in\" the enemy King using the Rook, use the power of opposition to drive the enemy King toward the corner, then move the Rook again to make the \"box\" smaller. Then keep repeating this process until you have the enemy King trapped on the board edge (using your own King's power of opposition) and mate with the Rook. But there are a couple of places where you can slip up and either block your Rook with your own King or otherwise let the enemy King slide away; if you accidentally do this, you have to start the process from scratch all over again. And if you screw it up more than once, your win can easily become a draw due to the fifty-move rule."

In natural evolution, the fitness of an individual is defined with respect to its competitors and collaborators, as well as to the environment. Within the evolutionary computation (EC) literature, this is known as co-evolution and within this paradigm, expert game-playing strategies have been evolved without the need for human expertise.

Theoretical analyses, however, suggest that in many cases minimaxing amplifies the noise introduced by the heuristic function used to evaluate the leaves of the game tree, leading to what is known as pathological behavior, where deeper searches produce worse results. In most minimax models analyzed in previous research, positions' true values and sometimes also heuristic values were only losses and wins. In contrast to this, a model is proposed in this paper that uses real numbers for both true and heuristic values. This model did not behave pathologically in the experiments performed. The mechanism that causes deeper searches to produce better evaluations is explained. A comparison with chess is made, indicating that the model realistically reflects position evaluations in chess-playing programs. Conditions under which the pathology might appear in a real-value model are also examined. The essential difference between our real-value model and the common two-value model, which causes the pathology in the two-value model, is identified. Most previous research reports that the pathology tends to disappear when there are dependences between the values of sibling nodes in a game tree. In this paper, another explanation is presented which indicates that in the two-value models the error of the heuristic evaluation was not modeled realistically.",
         "Introduction": "The minimax principle lies at the heart of almost every game-playing program. Programs typically choose the best move by searching the game tree, heuristically evaluating the leaves and then propagating their values to the root using the minimax principle. In practice, deeper searches generally produce better results. However, mathematical analysis indicates that under certain seemingly sensible conditions, the opposite is true: minimaxing amplifies the error of the heuristic evaluation "

Courage is almost as requisite for the good conduct of this game as in a real battle; for, if he imagines himself opposed by one that is much his superior in skill, his mind is so intent on the defensive part, that an advantage passes unobserved.\" "

There has been considerable work on suggestions of distributed architectures that could be scalable with the number of users. Most of them are web based and on fixed workstations whereby mobility is completely absent. In this paper we are discussing the roadmap to a massive multiplayer game framework that would enable a large number of mobile learners to interact through an exciting large scale game.",
         "Introduction": "We are first examining existing collaborative frameworks and how the different parameters involved and behave in a particular game scenario. The different steps in the game initialization and a hybrid architecture model are discussed. The chess game is considered as a prototype to validate the methodology. The chess game has been chosen for its complexity and memory efforts and time constraints on the different players. A prototype was first developed and tested on the Tic Tac Toe game which contains some similarities with the chess game."

In particular, we examine whether players from the former Soviet Union acted as a cartel in international tournaments --intentionally drawing against one another in order to focus effort on non-Soviet opponents --to maximize the chance of some Soviet winning. Using data from international qualifying tournaments as well as USSR national tournaments, we estimate models to test for collusion. Our results are consistent with Soviet draw-collusion and inconsistent with Soviet competition. Simulations of the period's five premier international competitions (the FIDE Candidates tournaments) suggest that the observed Soviet sweep was a 75%-probability event under collusion but only a 25%-probability event had the Soviet players not colluded.",

Observed-Action Reasoning is the problem of reasoning about the world state after a sequence of partial observations of actions and states. In this paper we formalize Observed-Action Reasoning, prove intractability results for current techniques, and find tractable algorithms for STRIPS and other actions. Our new algorithms update a representation of all possible world states (the belief state) in logic using new logical constants for unknown objects. A straightforward application of this idea is incorrect, and we identify and add two key amendments. We also present successful experimental results for our algorithm in Blocks-world domains of varying sizes and in Kriegspiel (partially observable chess). These results are promising for relating sensors with symbols, partial-knowledge games, multi-agent decision making, and AI planning.",

In this chapter we will introduce some of the key concepts of complex networks and review some of the major findings from the field. Leading on from this background material we will show that analysing the patterns of interconnections between agents can be used to detect dominance relationships. Another important aspect of social order is the enforcement of social norms. By coupling network theory, game theory and evolutionary algorithms, we will examine the role that social networks (the structure of the interactions between agents) play in the emergence of social norms. Empirical and theoretical studies of networks are important stepping stones in gaining a deeper understanding of the dynamics and organisation of the complex systems that surround us.",

In the experiment two players alternately are faced with the decision of either taking an exponentially growing pile of money and ending the game, or letting the other player make the decision. The player who decides to stop the game takes the larger portion of the pile, and the other player gets the remaining amount. All standard equilibrium concepts dictate that the player who decides first must stop the game immediately. There is vast experimental evidence, however, that this rarely occurs. Contrary to this evidence our results show that 69% of chess players stop the game immediately. When we restrict attention to chess Grandmasters this percentage escalates to 100%.",

The \"paranoid\" model is an information-set analog of the minimax rule used in perfect-information games. The \"overconfident\" model assumes the opponent moves randomly. Our experimental tests in the game of kriegspiel chess (an imperfect-information variant of chess) produced surprising results: (1) against each other, and against one of the kriegspiel algorithms presented at IJCAI-05, the overconfident model usually outperformed the paranoid model; (2) the performance of both models depended greatly on how well the model corresponded to the opponent's behavior. These results suggest that the usual assumption of perfect-information game tree search-that the opponent will choose the best possible move-isn't as useful in imperfect-information games.",

         "Abstract": "We propose an approach to the learning of long-term plans for playing chess endgames. We assume that a computer-generated database for an endgame is available, such as the king and rook vs. king, or king and queen vs. king and rook endgame. For each position in the endgame, the database gives the \"value\" of the position in terms of the minimum number of moves needed by the stronger side to win given that both sides play optimally. We propose a method for automatically dividing the endgame into stages characterised by different objectives of play. For each stage of such a game plan, a stagespecific evaluation function is induced, to be used by minimax search when playing the endgame. We aim at learning playing strategies that give good insight into the principles of playing specific endgames. Games played by these strategies should resemble human expert's play in achieving goals and subgoals reliably, but not necessarily as quickly as possible.",
         "Introduction": "The standard approach used in chess playing programs relies on the minimax principle, efficiently implemented by alpha-beta algorithm, plus a heuristic evaluation function. This approach has proved to work particularly well in situations in which short-term tactics are prevalent, when evaluation function can easily recognise within the search horizon the consequences of good or bad moves. The weakness of this approach may show in positions that require long-term planning beyond the search horizon."

Since every optimistic heuristic function is admissible, optimistic functions are widely used. We show, however, that with incomplete, real-time search, optimistic functions lose their appeal, and in fact they may hinder the search under quite reasonable conditions. Under these conditions the exact opposite is to be preferred, i.e. pessimistic heuristic functions that never underestimate the difficulty of the problem. We demonstrate that such heuristics behave better than optimistic ones of equal quality on a standard testbed using RTA* search method.",

Despite a lot of research in this field, there are still some open questions, e.g., what happens at search depths beyond 12 plies, and what is the effect of the program's knowledge on diminishing returns? The paper presents an experiment that attempts to answer these questions. The results (a) confirm that diminishing returns in chess exist, and (b) show that the amount of knowledge a program has influences when diminishing returns will start to manifest themselves.",
         "Introduction": "The phenomenon of diminishing returns for additional search effort in chess has been a burning issue in the game-playing scientific community. The consensus was that diminishing returns, as in all the other games observed, do exist in chess as well. However, for a very long time the experimental results did not back convincingly this opinion. This even sprung research into another direction, namely, to find reasons what is it that masks the manifestation of diminishing returns in chess "

The primary prediction of this mental-exercise hypothesis is that the rate of age-related decline in measures of cognitive functioning will be less pronounced for people who are more mentally active, or, equivalently, that the cognitive differences among people who vary in level of mental activity will be greater with increased age. Although many training studies, and comparisons involving experts, people in specific occupations, and people whose mental activity levels are determined by their self-reports, have found a positive relation between level of activity and level of cognitive functioning, very few studies have found an interactive effect of age and mental activity on measures of cognitive functioning. Despite the current lack of empirical evidence for the idea that the rate of mental aging is moderated by amount of mental activity, there may be personal benefits to assuming that the mental-exercise hypothesis is true."

The algorithms try to discover dependencies (and independencies) from the data using statistical hypothesis tests. This approach is constraint based and a structure edge is learned if meeting a constraint (i.e. passes a conditional independence test) derived from comparing the value of a statistical based test of conditional independence to a threshold. Meeting such constraints enables the formation of an undirected graph based on causality inference rules."

This distribution has numerous applications in computer Go, including serving as an efficient stand-alone Go player. It would also be effective as a move selector and move sorter for game tree search and as a training tool for Go players. Our method has two major components: a) a pattern extraction scheme for efficiently harvesting patterns of given size and shape from expert game records and b) a Bayesian learning algorithm (in two variants) that learns a distribution over the values of a move given a board position based on the local pattern context. The system is trained on 181,000 expert games and shows excellent prediction performance as indicated by its ability to perfectly predict the moves made by professional Go players in 34% of test positions.",

In this paper, we describe a novel tamper-response system that evades hacker detection by introducing delayed, probabilistic failures in a program. This is accomplished by corrupting the program's internal state at well-chosen locations. Our tamper-response system smoothly blends in with the program and leaves no noticeable traces behind, making it very difficult for a hacker to detect its existence. The paper also presents empirical results to demonstrate the efficacy of our system.",

We compared planning performance between chess ( N \u00bc 25) and non-chess players ( N \u00bc 25) using a standard psychometric planning task, the Tower of London (ToL) test. We also assessed fluid intelligence (Raven Test), as well as verbal and visuospatial working memory. As expected, chess players showed better planning performance than non-chess players, an effect most strongly expressed in difficult problems. On the other hand, they showed longer planning and movement execution times, especially for incorrectly solved trials. No differences in fluid intelligence and verbal/visuospatial working memory were found between both groups. These findings indicate that better performance in chess players is associated with disproportionally longer solution times, although it remains to be investigated whether motivational or strategic differences account for this result.",

         "Abstract": "Chinese-chess rules for cyclic moves differ from Westernchess rules in two respects. First the outcome of a cyclic game can be a win, a loss, or a draw. Second, depending on the plies made inside a loop, there are up to 16 rules a player can violate when a loop occurs. However, the same rule has to be violated three times in a row, i.e., in three consecutive loops, in order to lose a game. Therefore, a player can violate different rules in three cycles and still achieve a draw. In contrast, Westernchess rules always define a game as a draw after three consecutive loops. This paper reports on an adequate implementation of the Chinese-chess rules used to decide the outcome of a game when it falls into loops. The rules are proposed by the Asia Chinese-Chess Association.",
         "Introduction": "It is important that strong Chinese-chess computer programs also have a good knowledge of the game's rules. Sometimes a player can win a game by forcing an opponent to violate the existing rules, instead of using chess tactics or strategies to capture the opponent King. However, it is not easy to apply the full set of Chinese-chess rules correctly without substantial performance degradation. There are two problems with regard to incorporating the rules into a game tree search algorithm. First, how to apply Chinese-chess rules accurately? Second, how to apply the complicated rules with a small (reasonable) performance degradation?"

         "Abstract": "The present study was designed to test the effect of self-explanation and prediction on the development of principled understanding of novices learning to play chess. First-year psychology students, who had no chess experience, first learned the basic rules of chess and were afterwards divided in three conditions. They either observed (control condition), predicted, or predicted and self-explained the moves of the computer playing a chess endgame of King and Rook against King. Finally, in the test phase, participants had to play the endgame against the computer and were required to checkmate the opponent King. Apart from their test performance, the conditions were compared on quality of move predictions in the learning phase. The self-explanation condition showed better understanding of the endgame principles than the two other conditions, as indicated by the move predictions in the learning phase that more often exemplified correct application of chess principles. Moreover, participants in the self-explanation condition more often checkmated the black King in the test phase than participants in the two other conditions. However, no differences emerged between the prediction and observation condition. This study showed that, even for novices, providing self-explanations stimulates the discovery of domain principles of chess.",

A Kriegspiel player has to guess the state of the game and progress to checkmate being in the dark about the history of moves (but he can exploit the messages of a referee). Thus, computer playing of Kriegspiel is difficult, because a program has to progress in the game even with scarce or no information on its opponent's position. It is especially interesting to study the progress of computer play of simple Kriegspiel endings. We show how we tested a program able to play simple Kriegspiel endings to see how it progresses through uncertainty.",

Players had to report their chess rating, the number of hours of individual and group practice, their use of different learning resources and activities, and whether they had been trained by a coach. The use of archival data enabled us to track the rating of some of the players throughout their career. We found that there was a strong correlation between chess skill and number of hours of practice. Moreover, group practice was a better predictor of high-level performance than individual practice. We also found that masters had a higher chess rating than expert players after only three years of serious dedication to chess, although there were no differences in the number of hours of practice. The difference that may explain the variation in rating is that masters start practising at an earlier age than experts. Finally, we found that activities such as reading books and using computer software (game databases, but not playing programs) were important for the development of high-level performance. Together with previous data and theories of expert performance, our results indicate limits in the deliberate practice framework and make suggestions on how best to carry out learning in chess and in other fields.",
         "Introduction": "Learning high-level cognitive skills such as those of senior scientists, virtuosic composers, and chess masters typically requires one to acquire a vast and meaningful knowledge base and engage in situations in which this knowledge base is used.

Amongst others, it is successfully used in most state-of-the-art Go programs. To improve the playing strength of these Go programs any further, many parameters dealing with MCTS should be fine-tuned.",

Although it is possible to make educated guesses for some parameters, for other parameters it is beyond imagination.

In this article, we discuss three parallelization methods for MCTS: leaf parallelization, root parallelization, and tree parallelization. To be effective tree parallelization requires two techniques: adequately handling of (1) local mutexes and (2) virtual loss. Experiments in 13 \u00d7 13 Go reveal that in the program Mango root parallelization may lead to excellent results for a specific time setting and specific program parameters. However, as soon as the selection mechanism is able to handle more adequately the balance of exploitation and exploration, tree parallelization should have attention too and could become a second choice for parallelizing MCTS. Preliminary experiments on the smaller 9 \u00d7 9 board provide promising prospects for tree parallelization.",

This merging operation allows an artificial player to apply traditional perfect information game theory tools such as the Minimax theorem. We apply this technique to the game of Kriegspiel, a variant of chess characterized by strongly incomplete information as players cannot see their opponent's pieces but can only try to guess their positions by listening to the messages of a referee. We provide a general representation of Kriegspiel states through metapositions and show a Minimax-like algorithm for building a metaposition game tree. We have evaluated our approach competing against both human and computer players.",

The skill of each participating player, say, every year is represented by a latent skill variable which is affected by the relevant game outcomes that year, and coupled with the skill variables of the previous and subsequent year. Inference in the resulting factor graph is carried out by approximate message passing (EP) along the time series of skills. As before the system tracks the uncertainty about player skills, explicitly models draws, can deal with any number of competing entities and can infer individual skills from team results. We extend the system to estimate player-specific draw margins. Based on these models we present an analysis of the skill curves of important players in the history of chess over the past 150 years. Results include plots of players' lifetime skill development as well as the ability to compare the skills of different players across time. Our results indicate that a) the overall playing strength has increased over the past 150 years, and b) that modelling a player's ability to force a draw provides significantly better predictive power.",
         "Introduction": "Competitive games and sports can benefit from statistical skill ratings for use in matchmaking as well as for providing criteria for the admission to tournaments. From a historical perspective, skill ratings also provide information about the general development of skill within the discipline or for a particular group of interest.

         "Abstract": "Kriesgpiel, or partially observable chess, is appealing to the AI community due to its similarity to real-world applications in which a decision maker is not a lone agent changing the environment. This paper applies the framework of Interactive POMDPs to design a competent Kriegspiel player. The novel element, compared to the existing approaches, is to model the opponent as a competent player and to predict his likely moves. The moves of our own player can then be computed based on these predictions. The problem is challenging because, first, there are many possible world states the agent has to keep track of. Second, one may be unsure about the characteristics of the other player which could influence his behavior, such as his level of expertise or his evaluation function. To keep the size of the state space manageable we consider a scaled down version of Kriegspiel played on 4 by 4 chessboard with only a king and a queen on both sides. To deal with an opponent with uncertain characteristics we use the notion of quantal responses developed in behavioral game theory. This allows us to consider only one prototypical opponent while modeling a whole ensamble of possible opponents. We implemented our approach using influence diagrams, and discuss results in example situations.",
         "Introduction": "Kriegspiel is a chess variant belonging to the family of invisible chess that encompasses partially observable variants of the popular game. Playing Kriegspiel is difficult first, because the player needs to maintain a belief over all possible board configurations. Second, the player needs to be smart about selecting its move, given its belief about the board configuration and given the likely responses of the opponent. Predicting the likely responses is, of course, crucial, and has a long tradition in Mini-Max approaches to fully observable games. Mini-Max assumes that the opponent has opposing preferences, but it it relatively easy to apply to fully observable games. In partially observable games one needs to model not only the opponent's preferences, but also the opponent's belief about the board configuration. Further, the opponent's level of expertise may also be in question in realistic settings."

Chess requires brilliant thinking, supposedly the one feat that would be--forever--beyond the reach of any computer. But for a decade, human beings have had to live with the fact that one of our species' most celebrated intellectual summits--the title of world chess champion--has to be shared with a machine, Deep Blue, which beat Garry Kasparov in a highly publicized match in 1997. How could this be? What lessons could be gleaned from this shocking upset? Did we learn that machines could actually think as well as the smartest of us, or had chess been exposed as not such a deep game after all?"

However, the English mathematician Alan Turing in 1950 proposed an operational definition of \"intelligence\" that basically said that if a person interacting with another unknown entity could not distinguish between a computer and a person, then that entity would have to be considered intelligent.

Chess shows much less decline than the physical activities. Rates of decline are generally larger for the longer distances, and for swimming they are larger for women than for men. An advantage of using bestperformance records to estimate rates of decline is that the records are generally based on very large samples. In addition, the age range is large. In this study the age range is 35 to 100 for swimming, 35 to 98 for track and field and running, and 35 to 94 for chess. The estimates also do not suffer from traditional forms of selection bias.",

In Experiment 1, participants had to carry out a change-detection task that used the \"flicker paradigm\". The results showed that during the perception of standard chess positions, experienced players-but not novices-quickly focused their attention on the most strategic patterns. In Experiment 2, experienced players and novices carried out a recognition task after having encoded chess positions for 1 or 5 s. The results indicated early encoding of familiar patterns without immediate strategic value, followed by the encoding of more strategic patterns.

We evaluate these algorithms in 9 \u00d7 9 Go against GnuGo 3.7.10. The first algorithm performs better than UCT with a random simulation policy, but surprisingly, worse than UCT with a weaker, handcrafted simulation policy. The second algorithm outperforms UCT altogether. The third algorithm outperforms UCT with handcrafted prior knowledge.

This report shows that the population of expert chess players in the north hemisphere shows a seasonal pattern, with an excess of births in late winter and early spring. This effect remains when taking into account the distribution of births in the population at large, using statistics from the European Union member countries. A similar pattern has been found with schizophrenia, and the possible link between these two phenomena is discussed."

In discussing chess strategy, we consider not only the strategy within each game, but a meta-strategy, or strategy of repeated games, as well. In considering the strategy of repeated games, we consider factors that will encourage the other player to want to continue playing with us. This would therefore include such factors as playing in a sportsmanlike manner, encouraging one's opponent, and even giving constructive suggestions. This strategy of repeated games has parallels in business as conducting business in an ethical manner, and giving customers the benefit of reasonable doubts will encourage repeat business.",
         "Introduction": "This paper will seek to demonstrate that there are a number of parallels between chess strategy and business strategy. As a corollary, it is arguable that playing and practicing chess may help business students, and in particular, students of finance and economics, to see issues more clearly, and to improve their academic (and later their professional) performance. This paper will discuss both the strategy of the chess game itself, as well as what might be called a meta-strategy, or the strategy of repeated games with the same opponent. Components of meta-strategy might include playing in such a way as to cause one's opponent to want to play more games, or even giving one's opponent pointers as the game progresses, in order to make future games more interesting. It also includes playing in a gracious manner, perhaps (except in a tournament where a substantial prize is at stake) allowing one's opponent to take back an occasional careless move."

A sample of 90 adult tournament chess players of varying playing strengths (1311-2387 ELO) was screened with tests on intelligence and personality variables; in addition, experience in chess play, tournament participation, and practice activities were assessed. Correlation and regression analyses revealed a clear-cut moderate relationship between general (and in particular numerical) intelligence and the participants' playing strengths, suggesting that expert chess play does not stand in isolation from superior mental abilities. The strongest predictor of the attained expertise level, however, was the participants' chess experience which highlights the relevance of long-term engagement for the development of expertise. Among all analysed personality dimensions, only domain-speciWc performance motivation and emotion expression control incrementally contributed to the prediction of playing strength. In total, measures of chess experience, current tournament activity, intelligence, and personality accounted for about 55% of variance in chess expertise. The present results suggest that individual diVerences in chess expertise are multifaceted and cannot be reduced to diVerences in domain experience.",

Chess has its origins in India and Persia, it spread to the Orient, and to the Arab world by the 9th century. In Europe, the game evolved as it was adapted to local customs and variations from the Arabic form. To the medieval recreationist, (such as in the SCA), this represents an opportunity to play chess by a set of rules that more closely resembles medieval chess. The most avid recreationist will be able to learn to play chess by rules specifically correct to the time and place of their persona. More generally, it would be possible to adopt a set of rules for a game we could call medieval chess. The evidence for the origins of chess, and the linguistic relationships that reveal its transmission, form an important part of the study of the history of chess. This topic is debatable because so little physical evidence remains with which to prove any particular theory. My intention is to try to envision what might have been possible in terms of the actual chess pieces and to track changes to the rules, by looking at original source documents and poems about chess."

Focusing on the game of chess we evolve entire game-tree search algorithms to solve the Mate-In-N problem: find a key move such that even with the best possible counterplays, the opponent cannot avoid being mated in (or before) move N . We show that our evolved search algorithms successfully solve several instances of the Mate-In-N problem, for the hardest ones developing 47% less gametree nodes than CRAFTY-a state-of-the-art chess engine with a ranking of 2614 points. Improvement is thus not over the basic alpha-beta algorithm, but over a world-class program using all standard enhancements.",

One important feature of checkmates, especially in chess problem composition, is economy. This paper proposes a computational function to evaluate the economy of checkmate configurations on the chessboard. Several experiments were performed comparing chess compositions and regular games to validate the function. The results suggest that the proposed evaluation function is able to correctly discern economical differences in checkmate positions to a high degree of statistical significance and correlates positively with the perception of human chess players. This evaluation function can therefore be useful in increasing the versatility of chess database search engines, as a component in aesthetic models of chess and aiding judges in chess composition tournaments.",
         "Introduction": "Zero-sum games of perfect information are those where every player knows all the moves. Examples include chess, checkers, go and noughts and crosses. Such games are particularly amenable to computation because in theory, a perfect game (i.e. where a player can either force a win or at least never lose) is possible by analyzing the game tree. In noughts and crosses for example, it is quite easy for a computer to play so that it never loses or at worst draws since the game tree is rather small. In checkers, chess and go however, it gets much larger. Even so, there is much that computers have been able to achieve there."

         "Abstract": "This paper will investigate the concept of emergence in relation to computer game studies. Emergence is a concept that in its broadest sense describes how various kinds of systems work, including solar systems, biological organisms and cities. A computer game can be analysed as a system on at least two levels. First, as a game system comprised of rules, and secondly, as a system that regulates social interaction. These two systems are often intertwined and can be difficult to separate analytically. This is an issue that has not been fully addressed within computer game studies, especially within the field that is now labelled ludology. With the ludological approach, the concept user often plays a subordinate role. This can obstruct analysis, as the actual use of games and the games' social and cultural context, might warp and transform the rules that are structurally embedded in them. The aim of this paper is to single out some of the aspects of games in which these two levels of analysis often get blurred, especially in terms of the concept of rules and game goal. The paper will focus particularly on multiuser games, where the social aspect is highly significant. My discussion of the concept emergence will rely mainly on theoretical reflections and vocabulary from complexity theory and social theory. Jesper Juul's use of the concept of emergence and his definition of games and rules will be the point of departure with regard to computer game theory.",

In addition some tempos are allowed. The main contribution consists in giving a strategy plan procedure of how a chess player checkmates or draws knowing that he is in a winning position using combinatorial game mathematical tools. By a winning position in a game it is understood a position where one of the players makes the last move in that game and as a consequence forces his opponent to start playing in the next game and so on, until at the end plays first in the Zugzwang and draws or loses the chess game.",

It starts out from an understanding of games as entities in which the impulse to play is inextricably linked to the desire to cheat, as the close etymological kinship of the Latin terms ludo (I play) and deludo (I cheat) suggests. Therefore, it can be argued that, in order to understand a game, one must play not only by its rules but also with its rules. This will be demonstrated using examples drawn from my own games research experience, addressing the ethical, methodological and epistemological implications of this practice.",

Even more interesting than the results themselves were the discussions that were elicited by the survey, first on the mailing list itself, and then on the gamecode.ca blog. What was striking about these discussions was that while most researchers in the field of digital games seemed to be familiar with the practice of cheating, many seemed to be surprised to find that this practice should be considered part of games research."

         "Abstract": "The opening book is an important component of a chess engine, and thus computer chess programmers have been developing automated methods to improve the quality of their books. For chess, which has a very rich opening theory, large databases of high-quality games can be used as the basis of an opening book, from which statistics relating to move choices from given positions can be collected. In order to find out whether the opening books used by modern chess engines in machine versus machine competitions are 'comparable' to those used by chess players in human versus human competitions, we carried out analysis on 26 test positions using statistics from two opening books: one compiled from humans' games and the other from machines' games. Our analysis using several nonparametric measures shows that, overall, there is a strong association between humans' and machines' choices of opening moves when using a book to guide their choices.",

Such programs have a sufficient understanding of how to play these games well, to enable them to teach weaker players how to improve their own skills, yet little has thus far been accomplished in this field. Here we describe an important step on the road to a World Champion calibre tutor program. The example used in this paper is Chess, but the general ideas discussed here are equally applicable to other games. The paper discusses many of the typical situations of interest that a strong human Chess player employs when teaching pupils how to improve. For each type of situation of interest some guidelines are presented to indicate how a computer program could identify such situations. This task is comparable to that of writing an annotation program, able to comment on a Chess game in the style employed in books, newspaper columns and magazines. A state-of-the-art example is presented of a game annotated by a World Champion calibre Chess program.",

A complementary hypothesis is that chunks are encoded by abstract, semantic information. This article extends recent experiments and shows that chess players are able to perceive strong similarity between very different positions if the pieces retain the same abstract roles in both of them. This casts doubt on the idea that POS information is the key information encoded in chess chunks, and this article proposes, instead, that the key encoding involves the abstract roles that pieces (and sets of pieces) play-a theoretical standpoint in line with the research program in semantics that places analogy at the core of cognition.",

Forty-two male-female pairs, matched for ability, played two chess games via Internet. When players were unaware of the sex of opponent (control condition), females played approximately as well as males. When the gender stereotype was activated (experimental condition), women showed a drastic performance drop, but only when they were aware that they were playing against a male opponent. When they (falsely) believed to be playing against a woman, they performed as well as their male opponents. In addition, our findings suggest that women show lower chess-specific self-esteem and a weaker promotion focus, which are predictive of poorer chess performance.",

In the case of two player games, the complexity question is usually as to whether the first player has a winning strategy. Since the classical games are frequently finite, it is generally the case that this complexity is actually zero. For example, in classical 8 \u00d7 8 Chess, it is known that one of the following holds (although it is not yet known which): either white or black has a winning strategy or black may force stalemate. Therefore, to avoid considering only single instances, it is usual to consider generalised versions of these games. For example, Generalised Chess takes as input an n \u00d7 n board, for some n, on which are placed any quantity of white and black pieces (subject to there being exactly one king of each colour). The problem is whether or not white has a winning strategy from this starting position. The complexity of this problem is known to be Exptime-complete "

This paper explores the application of coevolutionary models to learn Chinese Chess strategies. The proposed Chinese Chess engine uses alpha-beta search algorithm, quiescence search and move ordering. Three different models are studied: single-population competitive, hostparasite competitive and cooperative coevolutionary models. A modified alpha-beta algorithm is also developed for performance evaluation and an archiving mechanism is implemented to handle intransitive behaviour. Interesting traits are revealed when the coevolution models are simulated under different settings -with and without opening book. Results show that the coevolved players can perform relatively well, with the cooperative model being best for finding good players under random strategy initialization and the host-parasite model being best for the case when strategies are initialized with a good set of starting seeds.",

The proposed technique uses only one central six-axis force-torque sensor embedded beneath the playing board.",

Examples of \"tokens and board\" games are such as chess, checker and Go etc. Many \"tokens and board\" games are now available as computer games played within an interactive two-dimensional (2D) or threedimensional (3D) graphical environment. The players may use 3D input devices, such as a 3D mouse or data gloves, to assign the move of a virtual token in the 3D scene of the game. However, the user of such devices may experience difficulties to select or grab a virtual token due to missing of tactile cues from the virtual token and the misinterpretation of the depth in the perspective view of the 3D environment."

Adaptive game AI (i.e., game AI that can automatically adapt the behaviour of the computer players to changes in the environment) can increase the entertainment value of computer games. Successful adaptive game AI is invariably based on the game's domain knowledge. We show that an offline evolutionary algorithm can learn important domain knowledge in the form of game tactics (i.e., a sequence of game actions) for dynamic scripting, an offline algorithm inspired by reinforcement learning approaches that we use to create adaptive game AI. We compare the performance of dynamic scripting under three conditions for defeating nonadaptive opponents in a real-time strategy game. In the first condition, we manually encode its tactics. In the second condition, we manually translate the tactics learned by the evolutionary algorithm, and use them for dynamic scripting. In the third condition, this translation is automated. We found that dynamic scripting performs best under the third condition, and both of the latter conditions outperform manual tactic encoding. We discuss the implications of these results, and the performance of dynamic scripting for adaptive game AI from the perspective of machine learning research and commercial game development.",

The findings are also consistent with the hypothesis that aging is slightly kinder to the initially more able, who show milder decline past their peak. Higher tournament activity levels predicted higher ratings overall and interacted with age in the initially more able sample, suggesting that activity had smaller effects on rating for older adults.

We propose to use Artificial Neural Network to obtain better evaluation function for endgame positions. This method is specifically applied to three classical endgames: King-Bishop-Bishop-King, King-Rook-King, and King-Queen-King. The empirical results show that the proposed learning strategy is effective in wining against an opponent who offers its best survival defense using Nalimov database of best endgame moves.",

One such accusation, frequently repeated, was that all the games in the 1985 WCC (Karpov vs Kasparov) were fixed and prearranged move by move. That this claim was advanced by a former World Champion, Bobby Fischer, argues that it ought be investigated. That the only published, concrete basis for this claim consists of an observed run of particular moves, allows this investigation to be performed using probabilistic and statistical methods.

In 1957, a year after the Dartmouth Conference that marked the official birth of AI, Alex Bernstein designed a program for the IBM 704 that played two amateur games of chess. In 1958, Allen Newell, J. C. Shaw, and Herbert Simon introduced a more sophisticated chess program (beaten in 35 moves by a ten-yearold beginner in its last official game played in 1960). Arthur L. Samuel of IBM spent much of the fifties working on gameplaying AI programs, and, by 1961, he had a checkers program that could play at the master's level. In 1961 and 1963, Donald Michie described a simple trial-and-error learning system for learning how to play Tic-Tac-Toe (or Noughts and Crosses) called Matchbox Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine (MEN-ACE). These are but examples of highly popular games that have been treated by AI researchers since the field's inception."

First-year psychology students, who had no chess experience, first learned the basic rules of chess and were afterwards divided in three conditions. They either observed (control condition), predicted, or predicted and self-explained the moves of the computer playing a chess endgame of King and Rook against King. Finally, in the test phase, participants had to play the endgame against the computer and were required to checkmate the opponent King. Apart from their test performance, the conditions were compared on quality of move predictions in the learning phase. The self-explanation condition showed better understanding of the endgame principles than the two other conditions, as indicated by the move predictions in the learning phase that more often exemplified correct application of chess principles. Moreover, participants in the self-explanation condition more often checkmated the black King in the test phase than participants in the two other conditions. However, no differences emerged between the prediction and observation condition. This study showed that, even for novices, providing self-explanations stimulates the discovery of domain principles of chess.",

It has been argued that an increase in time pressure during a game selectively hinders the ability to engage in slow processes. Here we study the eVect of time pressure on expert chess performance in order to test the hypothesis that compared to weak players, strong players depend relatively heavily on fast processes. In the Wrst study we examine the performance of players of various strengths at an online chess server, for games played under diVerent time controls. In a second study we examine the eVect of time controls on performance in world championship matches. Both studies consistently show that skill diVerences between players become less predictive of the game outcome as the time controls are tightened. This result indicates that slow processes are at least as important for strong players as they are for weak players. Our Wndings pose a challenge for current theorizing in the Weld of expertise and chess.",

One possibility, loosely originating in research on creativity and skill acquisition, is that an increase in expertise can lead to inflexibility of thought due to automation of procedures. Yet another possibility, based on expertise research, is that experts' knowledge leads to flexibility of thought. We tested these two possibilities in a series of experiments using the Einstellung (set) effect paradigm. Chess players tried to solve problems that had both a familiar but non-optimal solution and a better but less familiar one. The more familiar solution induced the Einstellung (set) effect even in experts, preventing them from finding the optimal solution. The presence of the non-optimal solution reduced experts' problem solving ability was reduced to about that of players three standard deviations lower in skill level by the presence of the non-optimal solution. Inflexibility of thought induced by prior knowledge (i.e., the blocking effect of the familiar solution) was shown by experts but the more expert they were, the less prone they were to the effect. Inflexibility of experts is both reality and myth. But the greater the level of expertise, the more of a myth it becomes.",

An expert chess player, for example, can play several games simultaneously without sight of the boards. But, paradoxically, it has been argued that experts may fail on problems that novices solve. When a novel approach is required, the experts' knowledge can make them unable to adapt to the new task demands. "

Our chess engine proved that reinforcement learning in combination with the classification of board state leads to a notable improvement, when compared with other engines that only use reinforcement learning, such as KnightCap. We extended KnightCap's learning algorithm by using a bigger and more complete board state database, and adjusting and optimizing the coefficients for each position class individually. A clear enhancement of our engine's learning and playing skills is reached after only a few trained games.",

Most chess engines therefore focus on a brute force strategy to search in the space of the next possible moves up to a certain depth only. Many pruning-processes are used, as well as linear position evaluation which incorporates knowledge based approaches in order to evaluate a special position. However, the main problem still lies in the correct tuning of the coefficients used in these functions. The method presented in this paper optimizes the evaluation functions and its coefficients by automating the use of temporal differences "

Such data often consists of varying amounts of measurements at varying time points. Applying the Elo rating system to such data has several advantages. There is no need for a growth model, both person ability and item difficulty are estimated simultaneous, an individual rating is updated immediately after a response and the algorithm requires no computationally intensive calculations. Several theoretical properties of the Elo rating system are evaluated, such as stationarity of the mean, of the variance and of the distribution. The evaluation of these properties leads to several variants of the system. A logistic, normal ogive and mixture variant are discussed, alongside with an adaptive element. The research concludes with an adaptive mixture variant of the Elo rating system in order to obtain a stationary distribution.",
         "Introduction": "In educational measurement, one increasingly popular demand is to follow student ability over time. Such systems are known as student monitoring systems. Examples include progress testing at the University of Maastricht's medical faculty, and at the psychology program at the Erasmus University. Also, progress is monitored by several products from Cito, the former Dutch central institute for test development, tracking several abilities throughout primary and special education. Clear reasons for the interest in this topic are the possibilities to track individual abilities and to compare individuals with their year group. Consequently, remedial teaching or accelerated programs can be offered to particular students."

For example, real-world scene contexts give rise to larger search benefits than contexts composed of letters or shapes. We investigated whether such differences in learning can be at least partially explained by the degree of semantic meaning associated with a context independently of the nature of the visual information available (which also varies across stimulus types). Chess boards served as the learning context as their meaningfulness depends on the observer's knowledge of the game. In Experiment 1, boards depicted actual game play, and search benefits for repeated boards were 4 times greater for experts than for novices. In Experiment 2, search benefits among experts were halved when less meaningful randomly generated boards were used. Thus, stimulus meaningfulness independently contributes to learning contexttarget associations.",
         "Introduction": "Contextual cueing is a learning effect where repeated exposure to a specific arrangement of target and distractor items leads to a progressively more efficient search. In these learning paradigms, intermixed among novel displays, a subset of stimuli are consistently repeated where the positions of the target and other objects in the display are fixed. Over repetitions, this covariation is learned and used to guide visual attention, causing search times for repeated displays to progressively decrease at a faster rate than for novel displays (which often improve as the search task becomes more familiar).

We combine two different theories that are widely used to establish rankings of populations after a given tournament. First, we use the statistical approach of paired comparison analysis to define the performance of a player in a natural way. Then, we determine a ranking (and rating) of the players in the given tournament. Finally, we show, among other properties, that the new ranking method is the unique one satisfying a natural consistency requirement.",
         "Introduction": "When there is a competition among the members of a population, the fundamental problem is to rank these members according to their performance. 1 In certain cases this confrontation takes the form of a tournament in which contestants play against themselves obtaining a certain score in each match. The aim is to determine a final ranking after all the matches have been played. Because of the wide range of applications of ranking theory, this problem has already been widely studied in management science, economic theory and statistics. The books by "

However, the usual interfaces for board games are based on the visual channel. For example, they require players to check their moves on a video display and to interact using pointing devices, e.g., a mouse. Hence, they are not suitable for the people who have visual impairments. The present paper discusses a multipurpose system for board games that allows blind and deafblind people playing chess or other board games over a network. In particular, we describe a prototype of a special interactive haptic device to play online board games receiving feedback about the game on a dual tactile feedback.",
         "Introduction": "A few years ago game-playing over the Internet was available only for rich communities, and online tournaments and championships of board games were unfamiliar concepts for most of the people. Year by year, the influence of the Internet on this kind of games is increased significantly. This has implied also side effects on the game itself. Regarding chess, for example, the availability of huge databases with the analysis of openings and endgames influenced the evolution of the game. Today, Internet board games and especially chess represent a great opportunity for players, trainers, professionals and they also have a strong impact on the younger generations of players. Furthermore, especially novices benefit from them, as they can learn and play the game at their convenience. The interest in chess among blind people has increased in many countries during years.

Progressive unpruning first reduces the branching factor, and then increases it gradually again.

         "Abstract": "Plagiarism is a growing issue in the field of game-playing software. As new ideas and technologies are successfully implemented in free and commercial programs, they will be reused and revisited by later programs until they become standard, but on the other hand the same phenomenon can lead to accusations and claims of plagiarism, especially in competitive scenarios such as computer chess tournaments. Establishing whether a program is a \"clone\" or derivative of another can be a difficult and subjective task, left to the judgment of the individual expert and often resulting in a shade of gray rather than black and white verdicts. Tournaments judges and directors have to decide how similar is too similar on a case-by-case basis. This paper presents an objective framework under which similarities between game programs can be judged, using chess as a test case.",
         "Introduction": "According to Merriam-Webster, to plagiarize is \"to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own\", or \"to use (another's production) without crediting the source.\" This is a particularly sensitive topic in the field of gaming software, in which ideas from previous programs are constantly worked upon and reused by the next generations and innovation is comparatively rarer. A unique situation arises with programs that implement artificial intelligences to play a well-known game, typically a board game like chess or go, or a card game like poker. These programs have a considerable market and by necessity share common traits since they all play by the same rules; plagiarism cases and accusations follow almost automatically from these premises. The situation can only worsen under a competitive scenario pitting these AIs against each other and allowing the gen-eral public to compare their moves. This paper stems from involvement in the examination of chess programs for the purpose of plagiarism detection and fitness for tournament participation under antiplagiarism rules. It provides a more objective framework for tournament judges and directors, as well as experts working for them, to make quantitative decisions on the originality of a game-playing program when compared to another, while trying to minimize the public controversy associated with plagiarism cases."

Like many variations of the Elo rating system, the whole-history approach is based on the dynamic Bradley-Terry model. But, instead of using incremental approximations, WHR directly computes the exact maximum a posteriori over the whole rating history of all players. This additional accuracy comes at a higher computational cost than traditional methods, but computation is still fast enough to be easily applied in real time to large-scale game servers (a new game is added in less than 0.001 second). Experiments demonstrate that, in comparison to Elo, Glicko, TrueSkill, and decayed-history algorithms, WHR produces better predictions.",

This report documents an implementation of an object oriented chess engine. Traditionally, in order to gain the advantage of speed, the C language is used for implementation, however, being an older language, it lacks many modern language features. The chess engine documented within this report uses the modern Java language, providing features such as reflection and generics that are used extensively, allowing for complex but understandable code. Also of interest are the various depth first search algorithms used to produce a fast game, and the numerous functions for evaluating different characteristics of the board. These two fundamental components, the evaluator and the analyser, combine to produce a fast and relatively skillful chess engine. We discuss both the design and implementation of the engine, along with details of other approaches that could be taken, and in what manner the engine could be expanded. We conclude by examining the engine empirically, and from this evaluation, reflecting on the advantages and disadvantages of our chosen approach.",

DP also involves the provision of immediate feedback, time for problem-solving and evaluation, and opportunities for repeated performance to refine behavior.

         "Introduction": "If we teach modeling we also need to grade models. But the task of modeling comprises a certain degree of freedom, and this renders exam questions on that task somewhat awkward: Assessments are frequently rejected by the examinees. This is either due to mistakes of the examiners or due to unreasonableness of the examinees. No doubt, the examiners make mistakes as the task of assessing numerous models is exhausting, requires fast perception, and great mental flexibility. But as frequently, students tend to challenge assessments on a pursuit for a better grade. Experience shows, that especially modeling tasks lend themselves to discussing every single detail of an assessment in terms of correctness and adequacy. Instant insight on the students' side seems aspirational to solve both problems: a) discover true errors made by the examiners and b) avoid exhausting discussions during homework reviews and post-exam reviews."

         "Abstract": "Since Chase and Simon presented their influential paper on perception in chess in 1973, the use of chunks has become the subject of a number of studies into the cognitive behavior of human game players. However, the nature of chunks has remained elusive, and the reason for this lies in the lack of using a general cognitive theory to explain the nature of chunks. In this paper it will be argued that Marvin Minsky's Society of Mind theory is a good candidate for a cognitive theory to define chunks and to explain the relation between chunks and problemsolving tasks. To use Minsky's Society of Mind theory to model human cognitive behavior in games, we first need to understand more about the primitive agents dealing with the relation between perception and knowledge in memory. To investigate this relation, a reproduction experiment is performed in shogi showing that perception is guided by knowledge in long-term memory. From the results we may conclude that the primitive agents in a cognitive model for game-playing should represent abstract concepts such as board, piece, and king rather than the perceptual features of board and pieces.",

Two well-known examples for this idea are the FPGA based HYDRA system and IBM's DEEP BLUE. Taking computer chess as an example in this paper a contrasting idea is introduced: A parallelized chess program running on a cluster forms a base component. With a second parallel approach on top several clusters can be used to achieve a further speedup. Results based on benchmarks and on the participation in the latest World Computer-Chess Championship will be presented.",

The technical properties are the following. Two compute clusters at a distance of 500 km, one in the University of Hamburg, one in the University of Paderborn, were available. The inter-cluster latencies of the Internet connections are in the order of milliseconds, while the intra-cluster latencies of the Infiniband interconnections are in the order of microseconds. Our approach takes this into account, resulting in a two-level parallelization. Within a cluster we use the Young Brothers Wait Concept (YBWC) parallelization "

The paper tries to establish a topology of such mappings, based on the notions of event structure and inheritance hierarchies. From the contrastive point of view, the findings show a high correlation regarding this kind of metaphoric conceptualization between the two languages, which may suggest a considerable level of universality, at least in cultures familiar with the game of chess.",
         "Introduction": "Are these chess words and expressions only nice rhetorical ornaments, metaphors as 'figures of speech', and why chess, not football words, for instance? Searching for a linguistic explanation of this phenomenon, this paper examines chess-related metaphorical expressions in English and Serbian from the cognitive linguistics perspective. The first part briefly outlines the main tenets of the contemporary theory of metaphor as presented by Lakoff and Johnson 1980 and Lakoff 1993. The following sections try to establish a topology of conceptual mappings from the source domain (chess) to the target domain (life in general, or, more precisely, complex life situations) and to offer explanations as to what makes chess so special among other sports that it becomes such a prolific source domain for life. The paper also examines a contrastive perspective, which indicates that this kind of conceptualization can be wide-spread in different cultures."

The author proposes an evaluation function for the concept of sparsity in such games. Sparsity refers to the general lack of concentration of pieces on the board and is inversely proportional to the perceived density. Evaluating sparsity is important from a visual perspective and useful for computational aesthetics purposes since dense piece configurations can be confusing and less pleasing to the eye. The evaluation function was designed with aesthetics in mind and comparisons with possible alternatives were done, suggesting its advantages. Experiments involving over a thousand chess positions were carried out to validate the function with promising results. An alternative method was also tested using the same data and it was found that evaluating sparsity is not as straightforward as it may seem. The work presented in this paper could therefore be useful to other researchers interested in a viable computational approach to the concept in board games or other areas.",

For this purpose, Western or International chess was chosen because there is a strong body of literature on the subject, including its aesthetic aspect. Eight principles of aesthetics and ten themes were identified. Flexible and dynamic formalizations were derived for each one and cumulatively represent the aesthetic score for a move combination. A computer program that incorporated the formalizations was developed for testing purposes. Experiments were then performed comparing sets of thousands of chess compositions (where aesthetics is generally more prominent) and regular games (where it is not). The results suggest that computers can recognize beauty in the game. Possible applications of this research include more versatile chess database search engines, more accurate automatic chess problem composers, enhanced automatic chess game commentators and computational aid to judges of composition and brilliancy tournaments. In addition, the methodology applied here can be used to gauge aesthetics in similarly complex games such as go and generally to develop better game heuristics.",

The search engine and the position evaluator, the two core parts of any such program, become quite sophisticated when all the necessary bells and whistles have been added. To maintain and further enhance such complicated software is an involved task, and the risk of introducing bugs or other unwanted behavior during modifications is substantial. A standard softwareengineering approach for verifying that new modifications do not break existing code is to use regression testing. To a large extent that approach is what gameplaying program developers use. They keep around large suites of test positions and verify that a modified program evaluates them correctly and plays the correct move. Additionally, new program versions play a large number of games against different computer opponents to verify that the newly added enhancements result in genuine improvements. Nonetheless, especially when it comes to the search, it can be difficult to detect abnormalities and they may stay hidden for a long time without surfacing. These can be subtle things such as the search extending useless lines too aggressively, or poor move ordering resulting in unnecessarily late cutoffs. Neither of the above abnormalities result in erroneous results, but may instead degrade the effectiveness of the search unnecessarily."

A further example suggests a complication, however, for Burge's treatment of computer-enabled apriori warrant.",

On this conception, apriority does not entail infallibility, unrevisability, or certainty. S may have apriori warrant for believing a proposition that later turns out to have been false. There may be cases in which S has both apriori and empirical warrant for her belief that p, and cases in which S's apriori warrant is over-ridden by empirical counter-considerations."

The class of chess endgames considered are those chess games that are built around a tr\u00e9buchet, are just formed by pawns and, whose configuration can be decomposed as a sum of independent subgames restricted to belong to one of the following cases: i) Zero or fuzzy games, and ii) Positive or negative games where the winner has the possibility of driving the game to case (i). In addition some tempos are allowed. The main contribution consists in answering the question of how a chess player checkmates knowing that he is in a winning position using combinatorial game mathematical tools. By a winning position in a game it is understood a position where one of the players makes the last move in that game and as a consequence forces his opponent to start playing in the next game and so on, until at the end plays first in the tr\u00e9buchet and loses the chess game.",

Such evaluation can, however, never fully capture the full complexity of games such as chess, since the impact of a feature or a pattern on the game outcome heavily relies on the game's context. It is a well-known problem in pattern-based learning that too many too specialized patterns are needed to capture all possible situations. We hypothesize that a pattern should be regarded as an opportunity to attain a certain state during the continuation of the game, which we call the effect of a pattern. For correct game state evaluation, one should analyze whether the desired effects of the matched patterns can be reached. Patterns indicate opportunities to reach a more advantageous situation. Testing whether this is possible in the current context is performed through a well-directed game tree exploration. We hypothesize that this can be done more efficiently than traditional tree search. We argue that this approach comes closer to the human way of game playing. An implementation of this algorithm must, however, rely on a yet inexistent pattern engine.",

Several extensions are presented that allow the ANN model to learn to predict the outcome of complex, uneven two-team group competitions by rating individuals-no other published model currently does this.

         "Introduction": "Alfred Binet, dans son ouvrage \"Psychologie des grands calculateurs et des joueurs d'\u00e9chec\" publi\u00e9 en 1894, s'int\u00e9resse pour la premi\u00e8re fois aux capacit\u00e9s cognitives des joueurs d'\u00e9chec et de la \"psychologie du combat\" lors d'une partie, non plus en analysant des anecdotes souvent exag\u00e9r\u00e9es, mais sur la base d'exp\u00e9riences et d'observations. Il s'interrogea en particulier sur les sujets pratiquant le \"en aveugle\", qui pouvaient donc jouer une ou plusieurs parties en simultan\u00e9 sans avoir besoin d'\u00e9chiquier et fit des analogies avec les \"grands calculateurs\". Pour lui, \"l'\u00e9rudition\" (connaissance du jeu et des strat\u00e9gies), \"l'imagination\" (au sens de visualisation et images mentales) et la m\u00e9moire \u00e9taient l'apanage des grands joueurs. Plus tard, Adrian De Groot, professeur de psychologie hollandais et ma\u00eetre d'\u00e9checs publia sa th\u00e8se en 1946 sur les exp\u00e9riences qu'il r\u00e9alisa afin d'\u00e9tudier les m\u00e9canismes cognitifs impliqu\u00e9s dans le jeu d'\u00e9chec. Traduite en 1965, (\"Thought and choice in chess\"), elle constitua une base solide de r\u00e9flexion dans le domaine et approfondissait les travaux de Binet. Il montrait que la diff\u00e9rence entre un novice et un grand ma\u00eetre ne r\u00e9sidait pas dans des capacit\u00e9s mn\u00e9siques sup\u00e9rieures ou dans la possibilit\u00e9 de calculer un nombre de coups plus important, mais dans la capacit\u00e9 de choisir \"le bon coup\", c'est-\u00e0-dire de d\u00e9terminer la meilleure combinaison. C'est donc l'organisation des connaissances et leur utilisation qui fait la diff\u00e9rence, ce qui recouvre un champs tr\u00e8s large de la cognition. En 1973, William Chase et Herbert Simon proposent un \"mod\u00e8le th\u00e9orique de l'expertise\" : consid\u00e9rant que la diff\u00e9rence de niveau entre les joueurs ne reposait pas sur les capacit\u00e9s de m\u00e9moire \u00e0 court terme ou de l'intelligence. Ils ont cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 montrer que c'est au niveau de l'organisation et l'utilisation des connaissances stock\u00e9es en m\u00e9moire \u00e0 long terme que la diff\u00e9rence se faisait. Le syst\u00e8me correspond donc \u00e0 l'apprentissage de \"constellations\" (qu'ils d\u00e9nomment \"shunks\"), qui activent en m\u00e9moire \u00e0 long terme des connaissances qui seront utilis\u00e9es pour un probl\u00e8me donn\u00e9 (strat\u00e9gie la plus adapt\u00e9e, coup habituellement jou\u00e9 etc.). Ult\u00e9rieurement Simon en collaboration avec Gobet, propose une nouvelle th\u00e9orie qui implique la m\u00e9moire de travail (\"Template theory\"). En d\u00e9pit d'exp\u00e9riences tr\u00e8s nombreuses et de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat port\u00e9 par les chercheurs, peu de choses \u00e9taient connues quant aux bases neurophysiologiques qui sous tendaient les m\u00e9canismes impliqu\u00e9s. Aussi, le d\u00e9veloppement de la psychologie exp\u00e9rimentale et de l'imagerie fonctionnelle a permis ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es d'\u00e9tudier les fonctions cognitives utilis\u00e9es pendant une partie d'\u00e9chec. Les fonctions ex\u00e9cutives sont donc impliqu\u00e9es majoritairement, sachant qu'elles interviennent dans les situations non routini\u00e8res et permettent le contr\u00f4le et la coordination des pens\u00e9es et des actions orient\u00e9es vers un but. Ainsi, la planification (qui permet l'agencement temporel des diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9tapes \u00e0 la mise en place de strat\u00e9gies), la flexibilit\u00e9 mentale (pour s'adapter aux exigences de l'environnement), la strat\u00e9gie (choix des moyens les plus appropri\u00e9es pour parvenir \u00e0 un but), l'anticipation et le maintien de l'attention sont tr\u00e8s sollicit\u00e9s dans le jeu d'\u00e9chec et d\u00e9pendent de l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du cortex pr\u00e9frontal, ainsi que des circuits qui permettent l'interaction avec les aires associatives. Or on sait que dans la schizophr\u00e9nie, il existe une atteinte de ces fonctions et que certaines th\u00e9rapies actuelles s'orientent vers la rem\u00e9diation cognitive (TRC) de ces d\u00e9ficits cognitifs. Lors du 6\u00e8me congr\u00e8s de l'enc\u00e9phale qui s'est tenu \u00e0 Paris en janvier 2007, Cavezian et ses collaborateurs (1) ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 les r\u00e9sultats d'une \u00e9tude o\u00f9 l'objectif \u00e9tait de mesurer l'impact d'un entra\u00eenement aux \u00e9checs comme outil th\u00e9rapeutique visant \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer le niveau d'efficience de ces fonctions initialement d\u00e9ficitaire. 26 patients schizophr\u00e8nes, stables cliniquement et trait\u00e9s par neuroleptiques \u00e9taient r\u00e9partis en deux groupes : le premier recevait un entra\u00eenement aux \u00e9checs de deux heures par semaine pendant 5 semaines, alors que le groupe t\u00e9moin ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait d'aucune intervention cognitive. Ils \u00e9taient \u00e9valu\u00e9s avant et apr\u00e8s 5 semaines par des tests classiques des fonctions ex\u00e9cutives : le test d'interf\u00e9rence de Stroop et la Tour de Londres. M\u00eame si les auteurs n'ont pas constat\u00e9 de normalisation des fonctions, le groupe \"entra\u00een\u00e9\" a montr\u00e9 des performances sup\u00e9rieures au test de Stroop (en particulier sur le sub-test de d\u00e9nomination, o\u00f9 ils lisaient un plus grand nombre de couleurs par rapport \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9valuation et le sub-test d'interf\u00e9rence) ainsi qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve de la Tour de Londres (augmentation du temps de latence des r\u00e9ponses avec le nombre de d\u00e9placements, montrant une meilleure capacit\u00e9 de planification). Ces r\u00e9sultats compl\u00e9taient une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tude de la m\u00eame \u00e9quipe qui montrait, chez des patients schizophr\u00e8nes novices aux \u00e9checs (N = 5), apr\u00e8s 12 semaines d'entra\u00eenement (\u00e0 raison de 50 mn par semaine), une am\u00e9lioration au Trail Making Test-B (temps moyen : \u00e0 To = 125.6s, T1 = 75.4s, p < 0.05 ; nombre moyen d'erreurs par \u00e9preuve : To = 1.8, T1 = 0, p < 0.05). En conclusion, bien qu'il s'agisse de petits effectifs en l'attente d'\u00eatre r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9s, les auteurs consid\u00e8rent que ces r\u00e9sultats soulignent l'int\u00e9r\u00eat potentiel du jeu d'\u00e9chec dans la rem\u00e9diation cognitive.

We define the concept of a community justified by a formal analysis of a simple model of the evolution of a directed graph. We show that the problem of deciding whether a non trivial community exists is NP complete. Nevertheless, experiments show that a very simple greedy approach can identify members of a community in the Danish part of the web graph with time complexity only dependent on the size of the found community and its immediate surroundings. The members are ranked with a \"local\" variant of the PageRank algorithm. Results are reported from successful experiments on identifying and ranking Danish Computer Science sites and Danish Chess pages using only a few representatives.",

The main objective for the work behind this paper is to establish a model of the community producing satisfactory answers to the first question. The model should also be small enough to enable a formal analysis leading to answers to the second question."

One of its heirs, computerized chess, was one of the first artificial intelligence research areas and was highly important for the development of A.I. throughout the twentieth-century. This change of paradigm between a tabletop and a computerized game has its ups and downs. Computation can be used, for example, to simulate opponents in a virtual scenario, but the real essence of chess in which two human opponents battle face-to-face in that familiar black and white chessboard is lost. Usually, computer chess research focuses on improving the effectiveness of chess algorithms. This research, on the other hand, focuses on trying to bring back the essence of real world chess to a computerized scenario. To achieve this goal, in this paper we describe a model inspired by the field of Pervasive Gaming, a field that profits by the mix of real, virtual and social game elements.",

Inspired largely by Randall Collins, I expand Coser's original framework by analyzing how the ritual of competitive play is structured in ways to heighten the intrinsic rewards of the game and further encourage commitment among the players. As such, devotion in chess is explained as a product of the following organizational elements: (1) isolation from competing social spheres; (2) encapsulation within a symbolic status structure; (3) a collective feeling of elite status; (4) trials of worthiness; and (5) prestructured ritual. After considering how these mechanisms operate in the world of chess, I discuss the potential of this expanded model of greedy institutions for future research across other social contexts.",

         "Introduction": "Chess is a truly international game of intellect, which has made deep inroads in to the psyche of people all over the globe in the last millennium. It has now been generally recognized that India is the homeland of this wonderful game, which has invaded all continents down the centuries. In its migration from India to different parts of the world, it is but natural that the game should develop a number of regional features, some of which later came to change its very form in a substantial manner. These changes are chiefly related the nature and movement of game pieces. Even in India, the game was not played uniformly throughout the land at different points of time. This fact is attested by the great variety of pieces available in different parts of India, whose movement also considerably varied from place to place. The development of chess from an original archetype into various regional forms can be compared with the development of several recensions from a single text like the Mahabharata or the Bible. It is possible to restore the original form of a text from the various recensions available at different points of time if we are to apply canons of textual criticism to the data. Now the interesting question is whether we can hope to know about the exact nature in which chess or Caturanga as it was known in India was played."

The KASER addresses the high cost associated with the bottleneck of knowledge acquisition. Further, it also enables the entry of a basis of rules and provides for the automatic extension of that basis through domain symmetries.",

This performance gain is achieved by evolving a program with a smaller number of parameters in its evaluation function to mimic the behavior of a superior mentor which uses a more extensive evaluation function. In principle, our mentor-assisted approach could be used in a wide range of problems for which appropriate mentors are available.",

Our experimental results using our grandmasterlevel chess program, Falcon, show that our null-move reductions (NMR) outperform the conventional methods, with the tactical benefits of the deeper search dominating the deficiencies. Moreover, unlike standard null-move pruning, which fails badly in zugzwang positions, NMR is impervious to zugzwangs.

We observed significant increase in the heart rate (75-86 beats/min), in the ratio low frequency (LF)/high frequency (HF) of heart rate variability (1.3-3.0) and also a decrease in mean heart rate variability with no changes in HF throughout the game. These results suggest a stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system with no changes in the parasympathetic system. The respiratory exchange ratio was rather elevated (over 0.89) at the start and significantly decreased during the game (0.75 at the end), indicating that energy expenditure progressively switched from carbohydrate to lipid oxidation. The changes in substrate oxidation and the sympathetic system seem to be due to high cognitive demands and bring new insight into adaptations to mental strain.",

Laboratory tests (e.g. speech tasks, arithmetic tasks, Stroop test, etc.) consist of a stimulus of short duration and of limited potency. Investigations using real-life stressors can be divided into those using chronic stressors (e.g. bereavement, unemployment, divorce, caring for patients with Alzheimer's disease, etc.) and acute stressors (e.g. academic exams). One advantage of using arranged stress situations (laboratory tests and real-life stressors) is that one can easily use each individual as his or her own control.

         "Abstract": "In this study, the longitudinal relation between deliberate practice and performance in chess was examined using a linear mixed models analysis. The practice activities and performance ratings of young elite chess players, who were either in, or had dropped out of the Dutch national chess training, were analysed since they had started playing chess seriously. The results revealed that deliberate practice (i.e. serious chess study alone and serious chess play) strongly contributed to chess performance. The influence of deliberate practice was not only observable in current performance, but also over chess players' careers. Moreover, although the drop-outs' chess ratings developed more slowly over time, both the persistent and drop-out chess players benefited to the same extent from investments in deliberate practice. Finally, the effect of gender on chess performance proved to be much smaller than the effect of deliberate practice. This study provides longitudinal support for the monotonic benefits assumption of deliberate practice, by showing that over chess players' careers, deliberate practice has a significant effect on performance, and to the same extent for chess players of different ultimate performance levels. The results of this study are not in line with critique raised against the deliberate practice theory that the factors deliberate practice and talent could be confounded.",

We propose a simple stochastic process that is able to capture the observed playing statistics and show that the Zipf law arises from the self-similar nature of the game tree of chess. Thus, in the case of hierarchical fragmentation the scaling is truly universal and independent of a particular generating mechanism.

Here we define ranking games as a class of n-player normal-form games with a payoff structure reflecting the players' von Neumann-Morgenstern preferences over their individual ranks. We investigate the computational complexity of a variety of common game-theoretic solution concepts in ranking games and deliver hardness results for iterated weak dominance and mixed Nash equilibrium when there are more than two players, and for pure Nash equilibrium when the number of players is unbounded but the game is described succinctly. This dashes hope that multi-player ranking games can be solved efficiently, despite their profound structural restrictions. Based on these findings, we provide matching upper and lower bounds for three comparative ratios, each of which relates two different solution concepts: the price of cautiousness, the mediation value, and the enforcement value.",
         "Introduction": "The situations studied by the theory of games may involve different levels of antagonism. On the one end of the spectrum are games of pure coordination, on the other those in which the players' interests are diametrically opposed. In this paper, we put forward a new class of competitive multi-player games whose outcomes are rankings of the players, i.e., orderings of the players representing how well they have done in the game relative to one another. We assume players to weakly prefer a higher rank over a lower one and to be indifferent as to the other players' ranks. This type of situation is commonly encountered in parlor games, competitions, patent races, competitive resource allocation domains, social choice settings, or any other strategic situation where players are merely interested in performing optimal relative to their opponents rather than in absolute measures. Formally, ranking games are defined as normal-form games in which the payoff function represents the players' von Neumann-Morgenstern preferences over lotteries over rankings. A noteworthy special case of particular relevance to game playing in AI are single-winner games where in any outcome one player wins and all others lose."

This paper applies the framework of interactive POMDPs to design a competent Kriegspiel player. The novel element proposed here is a way to handle complexity in I-POMDPs by using the notion of quantal response developed in behavioral game theory. This allows us to model only one (or a few) prototypical opponents while representing a whole ensemble of possible levels of expertise of the opponent's evaluation functions. The model is used to predict the opponent's likely moves. The moves of our own player can then be computed based on these predictions. Furthermore, we explore practical considerations when approximating I-POMDP solutions. Due to the immense number of possible states in a game of chess, we approximate the distribution over states using a sampling of possible states. We show the practical viability of our approach by testing a Kriegspiel playing agent against human players.",
         "Introduction": "Kriegspiel is a chess variant belonging to the family of invisible chess that encompasses partially observable variants of the popular game. Playing Kriegspiel is difficult, first, because the player needs to maintain a belief over all possible board configurations. Second, the player needs to select his move, given his belief about the board configuration and given the likely responses of the opponent. Predicting the likely responses is crucial and has a long tradition in minimax approaches to fully observable games. Minimax assumes that the players are rational and have opposing preferences, which is common knowledge. "

Yet the intelligence emerging from them is phenomenal. A human spectator cannot tell the difference between a brilliant computer game and one played by Kasparov. Chess played by today's machines looks extraordinary, full of imagination and creativity. Such elements may be the reason that computers are superior to humans in the sport of kings, at least for the moment.",

         "Introduction": "According to Merriam-Webster, to plagiarize is \"to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own\", or \"to use (another's production) without crediting the source.\" This is a particularly sensitive topic in the field of gaming software, in which ideas from previous programs are constantly worked upon and reused by the next generations and innovation is comparatively rarer. A unique situation arises with programs that implement artificial intelligences to play a well-known game, typically a board game like chess or go, or a card game like poker. These programs have a considerable market and by necessity share common traits since they all play by the same rules; plagiarism cases and accusations follow almost automatically from these premises. The situation can only worsen under a competitive scenario pitting these AIs against each other and allowing the general public to compare their moves. This paper stems from involvement in the examination of chess programs for the purpose of plagiarism detection and fitness for tournament participation under antiplagiarism rules. It provides a more objective framework for tournament judges and directors, as well as experts working for them, to make quantitative decisions on the originality of a game-playing program when compared to another, while trying to minimize the public controversy associated with plagiarism cases."

In this paper we explore its application to the game of Kriegspiel (invisible chess), providing three Monte Carlo methods of increasing strength for playing the game with little specific knowledge. We compare these Monte Carlo agents to the strongest known minimax-based Kriegspiel player, obtaining significantly better results with a considerably simpler logic and less domain-specific knowledge.",
         "Introduction": "Imperfect information games provide a good model and testbed for many real-world problems and situations involving decision making under uncertainty. They typically involve a combination of complex tasks such as heuristic search, belief state reconstruction and opponent modeling, and they can be very difficult for a computer agent to play well. Some games are particularly challenging because at any time, the number of possible, indistinguishable states far exceeds the storage and computational abilities of presentday computers. In this paper, the focus is on one such game, Kriegspiel or invisible chess. It has several features that make it interesting: firstly, its rules are identical to those of a very well-known game and only the players' perception of the board is different, only being able to see their own pieces; secondly, it is a game with a huge number of states and limited means of acquiring information; and finally, the nature of uncertainty is entirely dynamic. This differs from other games such as Phantom Go or Stratego, wherein a newly discovered piece of information remains valid for the rest of the game. Information in Kriegspiel is scarce, precious and ages fast."

While this technique is supposed to be only used in games of perfect information, this paper shows that retrograde analysis can be applied to certain Kriegspiel (invisible chess) endgames, such as King and Rook versus King. Using brute force and a suitable data representation, one can achieve perfect play, with perfection meaning fastest checkmate in the worst case and without making any assumptions on the opponent.",

Playing Kriegspiel is difficult, first, because the player needs to maintain a belief over all possible board configurations. Second, the player needs to select his move, given his belief about the board configuration and given the likely responses of the opponent. Predicting the likely responses is crucial and has a long tradition in minimax approaches to fully observable games. Minimax assumes that the players are rational and have opposing preferences, which is common knowledge."

Several important principles are reformulated for the purpose of better decision-making. In such a world, a virtuous person is not the one whose targets are too concrete, thereby binding him on a way without divergences. Taking an advantage is the one who can endure uncertainty, sustain flexibility, and seize an opportunity. Finally, we conclude that these principles might provide powerful action theories for the explanation of sociological phenomena arising in complex environments.",

In discussing chess strategy, we consider not only the strategy within each game, but a meta-strategy, or strategy of repeated games, as well. In considering the strategy of repeated games, we consider factors that will encourage the other player to want to continue playing with us. This would therefore include such factors as playing in a sportsmanlike manner, encouraging one's opponent, and even giving constructive suggestions. This strategy of repeated games has parallels in business, as conducting business in an ethical manner, making deliveries and payments on time and giving customers the benefit of reasonable doubts will encourage repeat business.",
         "Introduction": "This paper will seek to demonstrate that there are a number of parallels between chess strategy and business strategy. As a corollary, it is arguable that playing and practicing chess may help business students, and in particular, students of finance and economics, to see issues more clearly, and to improve their academic (and later their professional) performance. This paper will discuss both the strategy of the chess game itself, as well as what might be called a meta-strategy, or the strategy of repeated games. Components of meta-strategy might include playing in such a way as to cause one's opponent to want to play more games, or even giving one's opponent pointers as the game progresses, in order to make future games more interesting. It also includes playing in a gracious manner, perhaps (except in a tournament where a substantial prize is at stake) allowing one's opponent to take back an occasional careless move."

There is no doubt that tablebases contain a wealth of knowledge, however, mining for this knowledge, manually or automatically, proved as extremely difficult. Recently, we developed an approach that combines specialized minimax search with the argumentbased machine learning (ABML) paradigm. In this paper, we put this approach to test in an attempt to elicit human-understandable knowledge from tablebases. Specifically, we semi-automatically synthesize knowledge from the KBNK tablebase for teaching the difficult king, bishop, and knight versus the lone king endgame.",

         "Abstract": "In 2006, Guid and Bratko carried out a computer analysis of games played by World Chess Champions in an attempt to assess as objective as possible one aspect of the playing strength of chess players of different times. The chess program CRAFTY was used in the analysis. Given that CRAFTY's official chess rating is lower than the rating of many of the players analysed, the question arises to what degree that analysis could be trusted. In this paper, we investigate this question and other aspects of the trustworthiness of those results. Our study shows that, at least for pairs of the players whose scores differ significantly, it is not very likely that their relative rankings would change if (1) a stronger chess program was used, or (2) if the program would search more deeply, or (3) larger sets of positions were available for the analysis. Experimental results and theoretical explanations are provided to show that, in order to obtain a sensible ranking of the players according to the criterion considered, it is not necessary to use a computer that is stronger than the players themselves.",

The space devoted by many magazines and newspapers to games and puzzles is a research topic that has mainly been ignored by scholars. Nowadays we are familiar with crosswords, sudoku, and bridge columns. Some Victorian periodicals printed brainteasers of various kinds, but between the 1850s and 1914 chess problems were the most common form of intellectual exercise in periodicals. Chess grew from a feature seen in a handful of titles at mid-century into one that was almost required reading in a weekly paper by the 1880s, sometimes as part of an \"amusements\" package. The columns themselves were an important driver of growth for chess, showing examples of good play, offering advice of various kinds, and running competitions, as well as providing puzzles for readers to solve.",
         "Introduction": "Notation enabled chess games to be recorded and reproduced for study. diagrams of chess positions (important for illustrating the chess problems) were made up with special type, which came into use in the 1820s. diagrams also provided visual variety to brighten up the look of pages: especially valuable in broadsheet newspapers before the days of large headlines. Chess enjoyed increased press coverage from the 1840s onwards. In the second half of the nineteenth century an extensive chess literature developed, in English and several other languages, including books and specialist magazines. Columns reached a wider audience, and catered to people who never joined clubs or entered competitions, as well as to regular enthusiasts."

Both are well developed in Poker-like situations, but less so in more complex game and model domains. This paper addresses both tasks by using Bayesian inference in a benchmark space of reference agents. The concepts are explained and demonstrated using the game of chess but the model applies generically to any domain with quantifiable options and fallible choice. Demonstration applications address questions frequently asked by the chess community regarding the stability of the rating scale, the comparison of players of different eras and/or leagues, and controversial incidents possibly involving fraud. The last include alleged under-performance, fabrication of tournament results, and clandestine use of computer advice during competition. Beyond the model world of games, the aim is to improve fallible human performance in complex, high-value tasks.",
         "Introduction": "In the evolving world today, decision-making is becoming ever more difficult. Professionals are increasingly working as parts of man-machine systems, helped or supplanted by intelligent, carbon agents. Those responsible for the quality of the decisions therefore have a need to (a) assess the quality of their agents, and (b) predict the probabilities of other agents' choices in 'zero sum' situations. These needs are clear in real-time financial scenarios -city markets, auctions, casinos -and for effective control of utility services."

A structured survey has been carried out of the intrinsic challenges and complexity of creating endgame data by reviewing the past pattern of errors during work in progress, surfacing in publications and occurring after the data was generated. Specific measures are proposed to counter observed classes of error-risk, including a preliminary survey of techniques for using state-of-the-art verification tools to generate EGTs that are correct by construction.

The best chess program was used to analyze games played by the world's top Grandmasters under both conditions. We have analyzed the Monaco 1993-1998 data set introduced by Chabris and Hearst (2003). The results showed that although a larger number of mistakes occurred while playing blindfolded, no significant statistical difference between the rapid and blindfold games has been found. Nevertheless, by applying the same methodology to the Monaco 2002-2007 data set a substantial difference between the blindfold and the rapid chess game was noticed. In this paper, we have addressed the possible improvement of the chess game quality and the advances in chess programs that may be responsible for detecting more blunders.",

We update this piece mobility database dynamically as we evaluate each new chess position (this database allows us to reward chess pieces for specific objectives they can accomplish in the future). We determine the restrictions placed on the future mobility of the pieces based on the mobility of the lower-valued enemy pieces. The central idea is that a better level of insight is obtained by this method. Initial results are presented.",

Often neglected in scientific accounts of learning and in instruction, perceptual learning is a fundamental contributor to human expertise and is crucial in domains where humans show remarkable levels of attainment, such as language, chess, music, and mathematics. In Section 2, we give a brief history and discuss the relation of perceptual learning to other forms of learning. We consider in Section 3 several specific phenomena, illustrating the scope and characteristics of perceptual learning, including both discovery and fluency effects. We describe abstract perceptual learning, in which structural relationships are discovered and recognized in novel instances that do not share constituent elements or basic features. In Section 4, we consider primary concepts that have been used to explain and model perceptual learning, including receptive field change, selection, and relational recoding. In Section 5, we consider the scope of perceptual learning, contrasting recent research, focused on simple sensory discriminations, with earlier work that emphasized extraction of invariance from varied instances in more complex tasks. Contrary to some recent views, we argue that perceptual learning should not be confined to changes in early sensory analyzers. Phenomena at various levels, we suggest, can be unified by models that emphasize discovery and selection of relevant information. In a final section, we consider the potential role of perceptual learning in educational settings. Most instruction emphasizes facts and procedures that can be verbalized, whereas expertise depends heavily on implicit pattern recognition and selective extraction skills acquired through perceptual learning. We consider reasons why perceptual learning has not been systematically addressed in traditional instruction, and we describe recent successful efforts to create a technology of perceptual learning in areas such as aviation, mathematics, and medicine. Research in perceptual learning promises to advance scientific accounts of learning, and perceptual learning technology may offer similar promise in improving education.",

Although there is significant enthusiasm and activity, to date, evaluation of HLI systems has been weak, with few comparisons or evaluations of specific claims, making it difficult to determine when progress has been made. Moreover, shared evaluation procedures, testbeds, and infrastructure are missing. Establishing these elements could bring together the existing community and attract additional researchers interested in HLI who are currently inhibited by the difficulty of breaking into the field."

The method is based on attempting to learn features of a player's individual evaluation function using the method of temporal differences, with the aid of a conventional Chess engine architecture. Some encouraging results were obtained in learning the styles of two recent Chess world champions, and we report on our attempt to use the learnt styles to discriminate between the players from game records by trying to detect who was playing white and who was playing black. We also discuss some limitations of our approach and propose possible directions for future research. The method we have presented may also be applicable to other strategic games, and may even be generalisable to other domains where sequences of agents' actions are recorded.",
         "Introduction": "In Chess, as in other popular strategic board games, players have different styles. For example, in Chess some players are more \"positional\" and other more \"tactical\", and this difference in style will affect their move choice in any given board position, and more generally their overall plan. The problem we tackle in this paper is that of applying machine learning to teach a computer to discriminate between players based on their style. Before we explain our methodology, we briefly review the method of temporal difference learning, which is central to our approach."

However, there are still many domains (primarily in the realm of game theory) that are too complex to search through with brute force in a reasonable amount of time, and so heuristic searches have been developed to reduce the run time of such searches. That being said, some domains require very complex heuristics in order to be effective. The purpose of this study was to see if a computer could improve (or learn) its heuristic as it runs more searches. The domain",
         "Introduction": "used was the game of chess, which has a very high complexity. The heuristic, or evaluation function, of a chess program needs to be able to accurately quantify the strength of a players position for any instance of the board. Creating such an evaluation function would be very difficult because there are so many factors that go into determining the strength of a position: the relative value of pieces, the importance of controlling the center, the ability to attack the enemys stronger pieces something that chess masters spend entire lives trying to figure out. This study looked to see if it was possible for a computer program to learn an effective evaluation function by playing many games, analyzing the results, and modifying its evaluation function accordingly. The process by which the program improved its evaluation function is called Temporal Difference learning."

         "Introduction": "Weather disturbances like fronts, influence human biorhythm, our biological balance becomes manipulated, and adaptation mechanisms are impaired. Our working hypothesis is that even the best chess players of the world are not exceptions from this rule. As their movements on the chess board, as well as the best possible ones, if they missed to make, are already assessed by computers objectively, we can use this game as a model of intellectual performance. By the date of the Abstract edition, 580 wrong chess moves were selected with the threshold of over 1/3 peasant to be lost. I.e. this is the minimum difference between the assessment of the positions after the best possible and the really performed move. (Obviously, all moves both sides in ca. the same number of games were checked, i.e. over 35,000 moves were assessed.) For assessing the moves, the most popular database is MegaDatabase 2006 (ChessBase-Hamburg), Chess Informant Expert from Chess Informant Beograd and the program ChessBase 9.0 together with the engines Fritz 10, Rybka 2.3, Junior 10. First of all the World Chess Champions, Karpov, Kasparov, Kramnik and Anand were examined played in the traditional big chess tournaments, category 19th and more (average rating more the 2701 Elo-points). We further selected the games by the top-ranked players of the world between 2005 and 2008. This selection is explained by the likely fact that they make the less wrong moves for simply the lack of chess understanding, moreover, as full professionals, they allow the minimum of non-weather disturbing circumstances (e.g. imperfect sleeping before the game, etc.). Their moves were selected as (i) very wrong move with more than 3.0 differences, (i.e. unforced loss of a knight, or a bishop, (ii) very weak move with an assessment of 1.0-3.0, (i.e. unforced loss between one peasant and one bishop/knight) and (iii) weak move with less than 1.0 assessment of the passed chance, or unforced loss of less than one peasant. These new data on mental behavior are statistically compared to a common set of diurnal meteorological parameters, including various near-surface and lower troposphere temperature values, sea-level pressures, relative topographies, precipitation amount and existence (duration) and wind speed. The data and the aerologic fields are retrieved from the ECMWF "

In particular, we examine whether players from the former Soviet Union acted as a cartel in international all-play-all tournaments -intentionally drawing against one another in order to focus effort on non-Soviet opponents -to maximize the chance of some Soviet winning. Using data from international qualifying tournaments as well as USSR national tournaments, we consider several tests for collusion. Our results are inconsistent with Soviet competition but consistent with Soviet draw-collusion that yielded substantial benefits to the cartel. Simulations of the period's five premier international competitions (the FIDE Candidates tournaments) suggest that the observed Soviet sweep was a 60%-probability event under collusion but only a 25%-probability event had the Soviet players not colluded.",
         "Introduction": "unreasonable to think that many real-world tournament settings are more akin to the repeated play against many opponents that one finds in the round robin format than to the elimination rules of a knockout format. The combination of the draw option with something similar to an all-play-all set of rules creates the possibility that collusion among a subset of players may upend at least some of the predictions from tournament theory."

We use a rules-based method to solve the problem, analyzing the search space and introducing the notion of black&white graphs. The table data is firstly used to compute possible results of all played matches. Based on the results as well as the total number of scored and conceded goals, possible scores of the matches are then computed. The solution strategy is experimented on several final tables from previous World Cup tournaments. Other experiments are conducted for various team standings, measuring the time required to process some specific data of up to 10 teams.",

         "Introduction": "The way computer programs play strategy games is quite different from the way humans play. Humans apply logical reasoning to make the best possible play. In perfect-information games like chess and checkers, a game-tree search is the core technique in a computer program's arsenal, augmented by good evaluation functions and clever secondary strategies. However, brute force alone is not sufficient for a variety of reasons. In perfect information games such as chess, checkers, and go, the game tree grows exponentially, thereby constraining the usage of brute force techniques such as alpha-beta search. In imperfect information games such as bridge and scrabble, the missing information renders it impossible to build the game tree in order to perform a brute-force search. A variety of techniques are used to counter this encumbrance. In other perfect-information games such as go and clobber, there is very little intuition in evaluating how good a position is, and consequently constructing a good evaluation function is not easy.

First, we introduce the architecture of Turk-2, we describe the human experiments and its evaluation.

At the same time, less explored source domains also emerge. Motivation for the findings is discussed in terms of the possible effects of culture, subculture, embodiment, and language. The theoretical implications of the study include an argument for the benefits of a data-based source domain analysis at the expense of focusing on conceptual metaphors.

         "Abstract": "In this paper we present our ideas for an Arimaa-playing program (also called a bot) that uses plans and pattern matching to guide a highly selective search. We restrict move generation to moves in certain move categories to reduce the number of moves considered by the bot significantly. Arimaa is a modern board game that can be played with a standard Chess set. However, the rules of the game are not at all like those of Chess. Furthermore, Arimaa was designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible for humans, yet challenging for computers. While all established Arimaa bots use alpha-beta search with a variety of pruning techniques and other heuristics ending in an extensive positional leaf node evaluation, our new bot, Rat, starts with a positional evaluation of the current position. Based on features found in the current positionsupported by pattern matching using a directed position graph -our bot Rat decides which of a given set of plans to follow. The plan then dictates what types of moves can be chosen. This is another major difference from bots that generate \"all\" possible moves for a particular position. Rat is only allowed to generate moves that belong to certain categories. Leaf nodes are evaluated only by a straightforward material evaluation to help avoid moves that lose material. This highly selective search looks, on average, at only 5 moves out of 5,000 to over 40,000 possible moves in a middle game position.",

We observed significant increase in the heart rate (75-86 beats/min), in the ratio low frequency (LF)/high frequency (HF) of heart rate variability (1.3-3.0) and also a decrease in mean heart rate variability with no changes in HF throughout the game. These results suggest a stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system with no changes in the parasympathetic system. The respiratory exchange ratio was rather elevated (over 0.89) at the start and significantly decreased during the game (0.75 at the end), indicating that energy expenditure progressively switched from carbohydrate to lipid oxidation. The changes in substrate oxidation and the sympathetic system seem to be due to high cognitive demands and bring new insight into adaptations to mental strain.",
         "Introduction": "Traditionally, the effects of psychological stress in man have been investigated using two different kinds of situations: laboratory experiments and real-life stressors. Laboratory tests (e.g. speech tasks, arithmetic tasks, Stroop test, etc.) consist of a stimulus of short duration and of limited potency. Investigations using real-life stressors can be divided into those using chronic stressors (e.g. bereavement, unemployment, divorce, caring for patients with Alzheimer's disease, etc.) and acute stressors (e.g. academic exams). One advantage of using arranged stress situations (laboratory tests and real-life stressors) is that one can easily use each individual as his or her own control. However, because of ethical and legal considerations, it is difficult to experimentally induce pure psychological stress. Also, it is difficult to avoid unnatural and artificial arrangements "

Our algorithm differs from previous approaches to learning from search, such as Samuel's checkers player and the TD-Leaf algorithm, in two key ways. First, we update all nodes in the search tree, rather than a single node. Second, we use the outcome of a deep search, instead of the outcome of a subsequent search, as the training signal for the evaluation function. We implemented our algorithm in a chess program Meep, using a linear heuristic function. After initialising its weight vector to small random values, Meep was able to learn high quality weights from self-play alone. When tested online against human opponents, Meep played at a master level, the best performance of any chess program with a heuristic learned entirely from self-play.",
         "Introduction": "The idea of search bootstrapping is to adjust the parameters of a heuristic evaluation function towards the value of a deep search. The motivation for this approach comes from the recursive nature of tree search: if the heuristic can be adjusted to match the value of a deep search of depth D, then a search of depth k with the new heuristic would be equivalent to a search of depth k + D with the old heuristic. Deterministic, two-player games such as chess provide an ideal test-bed for search bootstrapping. The intricate tactics require a significant level of search to provide an accurate position evaluation; learning without search has produced little success in these domains. Much of the prior work in learning from search has been performed in chess or similar two-player games, allowing for clear comparisons with existing methods. "

The nature of the variation in aptitudes and exceptional talents across different domains was investigated in a population based twin sample. Self-report data from 1,685 twin pairs (12-24 years) were analyzed for Music, Arts, Writing, Language, Chess, Mathematics, Sports, Memory, and Knowledge. The influence of shared environment was small for both aptitude and talent. Additive and non-additive genetic effects explained the major part of the substantial familial clustering in the aptitude measures with heritability estimates ranging between .32 and .71. Heritability estimates for talents were higher and ranged between .50 and .92. In general, the genetic architecture for aptitude and talent was similar in men and women. Genetic factors contribute to a large extent to variation in aptitude and talent across different domains of intellectual, creative, and sports abilities.",
         "Introduction": "Familial clustering of talent and giftedness has been described in various case studies of legendary families. For example, the Bach family showed a remarkable concentration of musical talents. All Bach sons grew up in a musical-social milieu, in which the young boys were trained by older family members. More recently, the Hungarian Polgar sisters became famous as advanced chess players, after being thoroughly instructed in chess by their father. Pedigrees of talented families suggest a strong familial component to exceptional ability. Case studies, however, provide insufficient information to distinguish between genetic and shared familial environmental influences. The question of whether genetic or cultural transmission causes variation in exceptional abilities and the means to develop skills through deliberate practice remains to a large extent unresolved."

The routine departure of the commander gives rise to the purpose of this study. A total of 108 participants enabled 36 planning teams of three individuals to be composed. The experimental teamwork task was based on the game chess and used a variety of different technological means to facilitate distributed planning, which were then compared with a collocated planning (face-to-face) condition in an A-B-A design. The results show that broadly comparable levels of performance in some areas are reliant on considerably different processes of team adaptation in others. Performance time and overall workload remained relatively stable, yet the number of chess moves made, time pressure and surprise recall performance were considerably elevated in the distributed planning condition. Overall, it appears that the commander can be kept involved in the planning process even though they are remote from it but with some caveats attached. Relevance to industry: Distributed teamworking is a major component of emerging command and control paradigms variously called Network Enabled Capability (NEC). An important challenge for realising the benefits of NEC is to design technology to support distributed teamworking in such a way that it is not merely technically effective but jointly optimised.",

They take place on a number of different levels each of which is situated within a diverging hierarchy, from Division level down to Platoons or Troops comprised of individual soldiers. The focus of this paper is on Battlegroup headquarters, relatively close to operations. An explicit and similarly evolved process for command and control is enacted by the Battlegroup so that an adequate and flexible plan is developed in a reasonable amount of time. A plan is considered adequate when it meets the commander's intent, provides clear guidance to all sub-units and enough detail to allow the effects of the available combat power to be synchronised at critical points "

Chinese chess is one of the most popular board games worldwide and many researches on move generation, position evaluation, searching, opening and endgame play, have been developed. However, few work has been done in the basic representation of Chinese chess board. Currently the representation of 10 \u00d7 9 integer array is widely used in Chinese chess programming. In this paper, based on concrete theoretical analysis, a new presentation of Chinese chess board with 6 long integers is proposed. Compared to the traditional 10 \u00d7 9 int-array representation that is often redundant in endgames, the cost of storage with the new representation is greatly reduced by an order of magnitude.",

In our project, the popular open-source computer chess engine, Beowulf, is used as our chess engine. Beowulf is simple and straightforward to use but it is singlethreaded; we make use of the platform-independent SDL ( Simple DirectMedia Layer ) libraries to make the engine multi-threaded so that it becomes more robust, and interactive and can handle multimedia features. Some recent developments in graphics including OpenGL Shading Language ( GLSL ), shadow casting, and texture mapping are used to enhance the graphical features of the game. In some cases, Blender, a 3D content creation suite is used to create some graphical objects in 3D Max format that saves an object as a composite of many meshes along with relevant information like lighting, camera position and UV mapping. A 3D Max object can then be easily parsed and processed by a C/C++ program by making use of the 3dslib library. Graphical objects are also created by the technique of Surface of Revolution, which makes the program more flexible and faster to run; display list is employed to improve the execution speed of the program.",

         "Abstract": "Monte Carlo tree search Partial information games are excellent examples of decision making under uncertainty. In particular, some games have such an immense state space and high degree of uncertainty that traditional algorithms and methods struggle to play them effectively. Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) has brought significant improvements to the level of computer programs in games such as Go, and it has been used to play partial information games as well. However, there are certain games with particularly large trees and reduced information in which a naive MCTS approach is insufficient: in particular, this is the case of games with long matches, dynamic information, and complex victory conditions. In this paper we explore the application of MCTS to a wargame-like board game, Kriegspiel. We describe and study three MCTS-based methods, starting from a very simple implementation and moving to more refined versions for playing the game with little specific knowledge. We compare these MCTS-based programs to the strongest known minimax-based Kriegspiel program, obtaining significantly better experimental results with less domain-specific knowledge.",
         "Introduction": "In this paper we present and study different ways of applying Monte Carlo tree search to Kriegspiel. Monte Carlo tree search has been imposing itself over the past years as a major tool for games in which traditional minimax techniques do not yield good results due to the size of the state space and the difficulty of crafting an adequate evaluation function. The game of Go is the primary example, albeit not the only one, of a tough environment for minimax where Monte Carlo tree search was able to improve the level of computer programs considerably "

This paper shows that a similar approach can be used to solve subsets of certain imperfect information games such as Kriegspiel (invisible Chess) endgames. Using a brute force retrograde analysis algorithm, a suitable data representation and a special lookup algorithm, one can achieve perfect play, with perfection meaning fastest checkmate in the worst case and without making any assumptions on the opponent.

         "Introduction": "It is possible to explore significant subsets of a game tree in such a way that, if a particular position is encountered during gameplay, its value has already been computed and the best strategy is immediately available. Most programs for playing chess include a so-called \"endgame database\", because the perfection of database-powered play is unapproachable by any evaluation function, and in some cases by the strongest human player. databases are usually obtained through retrograde analysis: a game tree is visited starting from terminal nodes, namely the leaves in the game tree corresponding to checkmates and stalemates, and then the analysis moves backwards in time to find out predecessors to those positions, until all possible layouts of the desired type have been explored. The concept has been widely studied since the '60s, so there is a large bibliography devoted to databases and their creation, especially for chess and checkers. For instance, the so-called Nalimov tables "

The players would issue orders to their units, and the umpire would carry them out, revealing to each player what their units could see, and no more. He would also resolve combat based on tables, rules and personal experience. Kriegspiel is thought to have been an important training tool for the armies that used it until the XX century.

         "Introduction": "Risk preferences are typically studied from situations in which individuals make decisions in isolation. In many instances, however, one individual's risk taking has consequences on the outcome of another individual, as in the case of competitions where decisions involve risk. To what extent characteristics of one individual affect risk taking by another individual is relatively unexplored. In particular, little is known about the role of physical traits on risk taking. In this paper we focus on attractiveness. In practice, it can be hard to get reliable data on outcomes regarding risk and attractiveness. Options as well as outcomes are not always easily defined when decisions are made outside of the laboratory, and as Eckel and Wilson   (2004) discuss, physical appearance could be used as a heuristic when people try to form an opinion about an unfamiliar individual's ability and characteristics. It can therefore be a challenge to disentangle attractiveness from for example beliefs about ability. We argue that the data used in this paper enables us to disentangle the specific effect of attractiveness on risk taking, by allowing us to study relevant outcome variables while controlling for aspects such as ability. Such information is publicly available, which means that the subjects studied in this study do not have to use attractiveness as a proxy for another individual's ability."

         "Abstract": "Evaluating agents in decision-making applications requires assessing their skill and predicting their behaviour. Both are well developed in Poker-like situations, but less so in more complex game and model domains. This paper addresses both tasks by using Bayesian inference in a benchmark space of reference agents. The concepts are explained and demonstrated using the game of chess but the model applies generically to any domain with quantifiable options and fallible choice. Demonstration applications address questions frequently asked by the chess community regarding the stability of the rating scale, the comparison of players of different eras and/or leagues, and controversial incidents possibly involving fraud. The last include alleged under-performance, fabrication of tournament results, and clandestine use of computer advice during competition. Beyond the model world of games, the aim is to improve fallible human performance in complex, high-value tasks.",
         "Introduction": "In the evolving world today, decision-making is becoming ever more difficult. Professionals are increasingly working as parts of man-machine systems, helped or supplanted by intelligent, carbon agents. Those responsible for the quality of the decisions therefore have a need to (a) assess the quality of their agents, and (b) predict the probabilities of other agents' choices in 'zero sum' situations. These needs are clear in real-time financial scenarios -city markets, auctions, casinos -and for effective control of utility services."

It is vital that such models are clearly faithful to the reality they purport to represent. This paper examines that issue and systems engineering responses to it, using the chess endgame as the exemplar scenario. A structured survey has been carried out of the intrinsic challenges and complexity of creating endgame data by reviewing the past pattern of errors during work in progress, surfacing in publications and occurring after the data was generated. Specific measures are proposed to counter observed classes of error-risk, including a preliminary survey of techniques for using state-of-the-art verification tools to generate EGTs that are correct by construction. The approach may be applied generically beyond the game domain.",

         "Abstract": "Computer chess started as a promising domain of research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) more than five decades ago. The basic idea was that as a 'thinking sport' it would be a good challenge toward better understanding and potentially simulating (human) cognition in machines. Unfortunately, it was soon discovered that computers could be made to play chess (and certain other games like it) using computational methods quite different from how humans are thought to think. This spawned a competitive computer chess gaming industry and in 1997, the world chess champion was defeated by an IBM supercomputer. Since then, computer chess has seen further improvement with programs playing at the strong grandmaster level even on desktop machines. In the field of AI, attention has therefore shifted to even more-complex games like Go in the hope that computational approaches toward them will succeed where chess had apparently failed. In this paper I challenge that contention. I have reasons to believe that chess still has some things to teach us not only about computation and its limits but also about the human mind and how it probably works. As such, this is not a technical paper but rather one on 'computational philosophy'.",

The unique approach taken (given the domain) suggests that, in addition to things like personal taste and environmental factors, humans also assess beauty based on universal metrics within the domain itself. From a computational standpoint, this means that weights for aesthetic features need not be, for example, determined by analyzing a particular data set of aesthetically-rated objects or through consultation with human experts. Instead, the metrics can be used as building blocks to formalize aesthetic principles or features in a logical and dynamic way that is arguably an improvement over existing methods. The aesthetics model is explained and relevant experimental results are presented. From a computational standpoint, the importance of universal metrics in the aesthetics of chess and other domains is explored.",

The best chess program was used to analyze games played by the world's top Grandmasters under both conditions. We have analyzed the Monaco 1993-1998 data set introduced by Chabris and Hearst (2003). The results showed that although a larger number of mistakes occurred while playing blindfolded, no significant statistical difference between the rapid and blindfold games has been found. Nevertheless, by applying the same methodology to the Monaco 2002-2007 data set a substantial difference between the blindfold and the rapid chess game was noticed. In this paper, we have addressed the possible improvement of the chess game quality and the advances in chess programs that may be responsible for detecting more blunders.",

The identification and management of stressors and the construction of resilient positions allow effective cut-offs for less-promising game continuations due to the perceived presence of adaptive capacity and sustainable development. We calculate and maintain a database of potential mobility for each chess piece 3 moves into the future, for each position we evaluate in our search tree. We determine the likely restrictions placed on the future mobility of the pieces based on the attack paths of the lower-valued enemy pieces.

These ideas do not arise on current computational models, which apply brute force by rotememorization.

However, there is no guarantee that these justifications will be understood by experts and other users. Induced models are often strange to the domain experts as they understand the problem in a different way. We suggest the use of argument based machine learning (ABML) to deal with this problem. This approach combines machine learning with explanations provided by domain experts. An ABML method is required to learn a model that correctly predicts learning examples and is consistent with the provided explanations. The present paper describes an application of ABML to learning a complex chess concept of an attack on the castled king. The explanation power of the learned model for this concept is especially important, as it will be used in a chess tutoring application.",

Particularly, several challenges arise to machine learning systems when inducing a model describing legal moves of the chess, including the collection of the examples, the learning of a model correctly representing the official rules of the game, covering all the branches and restrictions of the correct moves, and the comprehensibility of such a model. Besides, the game of chess has inspired the creation of numerous variants, ranging from faster to more challenging or to regional versions of the game. The question arises if it is possible to take advantage of an initial classifier of chess as a starting point to obtain classifiers for the different variants. We approach this problem as an instance of theory revision from examples. The initial classifier of chess is inspired by a FOL theory approved by a chess expert and the examples are defined as sequences of moves within a game. Starting from a standard revision system, we argue that abduction and negation are also required to best address this problem. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.",

A potential criticism of this assumption is that the opponent may not have the ability to decide accurately what move this is.

         "Abstract": "Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees (UCT), a banditbased Monte-Carlo sampling algorithm for planning, has recently been the subject of great interest in adversarial reasoning. UCT has been shown to outperform traditional minimax based approaches in several challenging domains such as Go and Kriegspiel, although minimax search still prevails in other domains such as Chess. This work provides insights into the properties of adversarial search spaces that play a key role in the success or failure of UCT and similar samplingbased approaches. We show that certain \"early loss\" or \"shallow trap\" configurations, while unlikely in Go, occur surprisingly often in games like Chess (even in grandmaster games). We provide evidence that UCT, unlike minimax search, is unable to identify such traps in Chess and spends a great deal of time exploring much deeper game play than needed.",

CHANCEPROBCUT is based on PROBCUT, a forward-pruning technique for \u03b1\u03b2 search. Based on the statistical correlation between evaluations obtained from searches at different depths, CHANCEPROBCUT prunes chance events if the result of the chance node is likely to fall outside the search window. For predicting the outcome of a deeper search, a linear regression model with a confidence bound is used. In this article, CHANCEPROBCUT is tested in three games, i.e., Stratego, Dice and ChanceBreakthrough. Experiments reveal that the technique is able to reduce the search tree significantly without the loss of move-decision quality. Moreover, in all games there is also an increase of playing performance.",

         "Abstract": "Rapid chess provides an unparalleled laboratory to understand decision making in a natural environment. In a chess game, players choose consecutively around 40 moves in a finite time budget. The goodness of each choice can be determined quantitatively since current chess algorithms estimate precisely the value of a position. Web-based chess produces vast amounts of data, millions of decisions per day, incommensurable with traditional psychological experiments. We generated a database of response times (RTs) and position value in rapid chess games. We measured robust emergent statistical observables: (1) RT distributions are long-tailed and show qualitatively distinct forms at different stages of the game, (2) RT of successive moves are highly correlated both for intra-and inter-player moves. These findings have theoretical implications since they deny two basic assumptions of sequential decision making algorithms: RTs are not stationary and can not be generated by a state-function. Our results also have practical implications. First, we characterized the capacity of blunders and score fluctuations to predict a player strength, which is yet an open problem in chess softwares. Second, we show that the winning likelihood can be reliably estimated from a weighted combination of remaining times and position evaluation.",

The algorithm combines a Monte-Carlo update of the agent's belief state with a Monte-Carlo tree search from the current belief state. The new algorithm, POMCP, has two important properties. First, Monte-Carlo sampling is used to break the curse of dimensionality both during belief state updates and during planning. Second, only a black box simulator of the POMDP is required, rather than explicit probability distributions. These properties enable POMCP to plan effectively in significantly larger POMDPs than has previously been possible. We demonstrate its effectiveness in three large POMDPs. We scale up a well-known benchmark problem, rocksample, by several orders of magnitude. We also introduce two challenging new POMDPs: 10 \u00d7 10 battleship and partially observable PacMan, with approximately 10 18 and 10 56 states respectively. Our Monte-Carlo planning algorithm achieved a high level of performance with no prior knowledge, and was also able to exploit simple domain knowledge to achieve better results with less search. POMCP is the first general purpose planner to achieve high performance in such large and unfactored POMDPs.",

This performance gain is achieved by evolving a program that mimics the behavior of a superior expert. The resulting evaluation function of the evolved program consists of a much smaller number of parameters than the expert's.

The Game Description Language (GDL) has been developed as a highlevel knowledge representation formalism for axiomatising the rules of any game, and a basic requirement of a General Game Player is the ability to reason logically about a given game description. In this paper, we address the fundamental limitation of existing GDL to be confined to deterministic games with complete information about the game state. To this end, we develop an extension of GDL that is both simple and elegant yet expressive enough to allow to formalise the rules of arbitrary (discrete and finite) n-player games with randomness and incomplete state knowledge. We also show that this extension suffices to provide players with all information they need to reason about their own knowledge as well as that of the other players up front and during game play.",

Elite male players' personality profile did not significantly differ from the population norms. Female players were more satisfied with life, had less physical complaints and higher achievement motivation in comparison with female population norms. Personality was also related with chess skill but showed different patterns in males and females. Stronger male players were more introverted, while we found the opposite pattern in female players.

Players can point and click the game window by turn to move the pieces with a mouse. Ideally, this game should be played on a chessboard, like regular chess, with real lasers and mirrors.

'My rating is rocketing sky high!', he shouts. Jaap is not very keen on a conversation with a total stranger. But this changes if he is allowed to play a game of chess with him. Then he talks incessantly between moves. 'If I play chess, I keep learning more and more. It's a fun sport, actually.' Jaap wants to learn to play good chess. 'This is a super championship!', he says. Jaap is suffering from Asperger's Syndrome. Because of this, he has few social contacts. In between tournament rounds, he plays games on his Nintendo. In fact, this is precisely what does allow him to make contact with other children, who come to him to see what game he is playing. 'If you share his interest, he is open for contact', his mother Annemieke has noticed. 'These games look individualistic, but for Jaap they are an opportunity to make contact with other children.' Jaap takes in sounds much more strongly than others, says his mother. 'His brain does not filter away these background sounds.' That is why he wears custom-made earplugs when he plays chess with other children. He keeps his kinetic unrest under control with a toy snake that he can fiddle with. Jaap plays chess every week, in the youth section of De Wijker Toren. Trainer Jan Sinnige teaches a group of four beginners. 'Jaap has a good contact with the other children of the group, but not with children from other groups of the youth section', he says. 'At the chess club he can gradually build up contacts', Jaap's mother tells me. 'He has no friends in the neighbourhood. At the chess club he feels at home.'",

'I've been playing chess for almost twenty years now. During a game I'm fanatical, but I don't study hard. I think that I like chess because I'm good at it.' Maarten suffers from the classical form of autism. After a stay of several years in the Leo Kanner House (a centre for treatment of young people with autism) in the Dutch town of Doorwerth, he is now living in a protected housing unit in Twello. There he works half-time in the public library. 'The rest of the day I'm doing everyday business like shopping and cooking. I also occupy myself with the computer, I read, and I play Scrabble.' As a chess player, Maarten has achieved some successes. He became Dutch champion with the E-team of De Schaakmaat and with the lower school team of the City Gymnasium in Apeldoorn. At one Dutch junior championship (under 12), he came fourth. 'I'm probably more self-involved than most people, but I like to have social contacts. My autism makes this difficult.' Autists take language literally. 'Sometimes people mean something else with what they say, and I often miss that. That makes me uncertain.' Autism occurs in different forms. 'In any case, autism is hereditary, and there are certain symptoms: in my case, a need for structure and clarity. My perfectionism makes it difficult to separate main issues from side-issues. And new things are scary for me.' During a chess game Maarten is in his element. 'I'm very good at focusing. Via the health institute GGNet I play indoor soccer. That's fun, but it's also hard. I am a slow thinker and I cannot size up a situation at a glance: should I pass the ball or make an action myself?' Tom Meurs (left) training with IM Merijn van Delft."

We submitted the students to a pre-test and a post-test. According to the PISA framework, questions were grouped by content and competence. We divided the students in an experimental group (formed by the students attending the chess course) and in a control group (formed by other students). By analyzing both pre and post test performances, we compared the performances by the students of experimental and control group, focusing also on content and competence. Unfortunately, statistics was poor, in fact 10 students only attended the chess course of 45 students participating to the investigation. In Education in general, and for this low numbers in particular, results are to be considered with great caution. We obtained outputs in a good concordance with our beliefs and with literature, in fact the experimental group performed better in \"form\" and \"uncertainty\" items about content, and in \"connection\" items about competence. On the other hand, no particular improvement occurred in \"quantity\" and \"reproduction\" items. In conclusion, the links between chess practice and maths skills are sound, but are not so general. Some benefits of chess practice seem connected to using of visuo-spatial abilities by the chess players. Concerning processes, chess seems develop problem-solving skill and a more effective approach to new situations and tasks.",
         "Introduction": "This paper is concerned with chess and maths education. We realized an investigation in a low secondary school in which a 30 h chess course was planned. We are interested in deepening possible links between chess practice and maths skills and abilities. It is not easy to realize an adequate investigation, because of multiple reasons. First, we know that \"there are no proofs in Maths education\" (Schonefeld), and also it is very difficult to find appropriate sets of students and appropriate chess courses. Last but not least, realizing good, reliable tests with appropriate methodology. Keeping in mind these reasons, we focused just to reinforce some beliefs about chess as an integrative tool in education, as emerged in literature. Various works were published about our topic, and different types of skills were considered, like cognitive skills, or social, with reference to specific fields also. Some basic items were sharply outlined. Several studies were dedicated to scholastic context, considering groups of students engaging in chess practice and their educational path. There are also studies on nonscholastic contexts, like chess clubs or population in general."

We employ a large international panel dataset with controls for risk preferences and playing skills whereby the latter accounts for ability.

Each king is considering his options: should he attack with the risk of losing or should he offer a truce? He knows that if he offers a truce, he signals potential weakness and that he would prefer not to engage in a battle, hence, offering a truce could encourage the opponent to attack. On the other hand, perhaps both kings prefer a truce but if none of them dares to offer it, they will have to take their chances on the battle field."

In this paper, we address this question empirically by conducting go-deep experiments with several heuristic-search based programs in the domain of chess. Our experimental results indicate that estimating the quality of knowledge in heuristic evaluation functions of typical chess programs that is based on Best-Change rates -the lower the rates the higher the quality of an evaluation function -produces sensible results, particularly when the mean value of Best-Change rates over several consecutive depths of search is taken into account for the comparison.",
         "Introduction": "Heuristic search implies an interaction of both search and knowledge. Faster programs can examine more nodes and therefore search deeper. And vice versa: using extensive knowledge to evaluate problem states accurately demands less searching. Complete knowledge about a domain renders search useless, and, likewise, searching through all possible alternatives requires no knowledge about the domain at all. In domains of any interest neither extreme is feasible, so a combination of search and knowledge is used instead. However, how big is the contribution of each of these components in a heuristic-search based program? How can we measure the quality of knowledge in the program?"

In 1950, information theorist Claude Shannon published a groundbreaking paper entitled \"Programming a Computer for Playing Chess\" that proved pivotal for future work on chess. Chess is a game of \"perfect information,\" which means that all players know the entire state of the game and all previous game moves. This, of course, is different from other games such as poker or bridge. Other games of perfect information include Tic-Tac-Toe and Go. Chess is also a finite game because of the 50-move, 3-move-repetition, and others that force a game to end as a draw."

However, the assessment of the chess study community's criteria of uniqueness has not yet been systematically assisted by the perfect information of EGTs. This note proves that this can be done by defining appropriate changes to the game of chess and analysing the impact of those changes as evidenced by the new chess variant's EGTs. Specifically, the values of positions in a set SP are redefined to create variant Chess(SP). The approach is practical and challenges authors of EGT generators to generalise them to accommodate Chess(SP). It also addresses a number of similar questions arising in endgame theory, games and compositions.",

Comparisons were made using 'experiences' derived from three different databases, i.e. problems by human composers (HC), computer-generated compositions that used the HC experience (CG), and mating 'combinations' taken from tournament games between humans (TG). Each showed a reasonable and statistically significant increase in efficiency compared to the random one but not each other. Aesthetically, the HC and CG were better than the others. The results suggest that composing efficiency and quality can be improved using simple probability information derived from human compositions, and unexpectedly even from the computer-generated compositions that result. Additionally, these improvements come at a very low computational cost. They can be used to further aid and entertain human players and composers.",

The subjects were assessed via meta-cognitive questionnaire of Panaoura, Philippou, and Christou (2003)  and mathematics exams. The results indicated that chess player students showed more achievement in both meta-cognitive abilities and mathematical problem solving capabilities than other non-chess player students.

As an instrument to teach problem-solving and abstract reasoning, we can use chess effectively. Learning how to solve a problem is probably more important than finding a solution for a specific problem. By means of chess, we learn how to evaluate a context and to this end, we should concentrate on the main factors and omit diversions. We may find original and imaginative solutions to accomplish the plan. Chess is very influential, since it is self-motivating. The game has attracted people for about 2000 years and the aims of attack and defense resulting in checkmate encourage us to penetrate into our mental store "

Here I describe how to perform dimensionality reduction while preserving the essential properties of the dynamics. The approach is illustrated by analyzing the chess game -the archetype of complex dynamics. A variable that provides complete and accurate description of chess dynamics is constructed. Winning probability is predicted by describing the game as a random walk on the free energy landscape associated with the variable. The approach suggests a possible way of obtaining a simple yet accurate description of many important complex phenomena. The analysis of the chess game shows that the approach can quantitatively describe the dynamics of processes where human decision-making plays a central role, e.g., financial and social dynamics.",

For that reason, understanding how closely the assumptions that underpin game theoretic analysis conform to actual human decision making is a question of first-order importance to economists. In this spirit, backward induction represents one of the most basic concepts in game theory. Backward induction played a prominent role in Reinhard Selten's (1965) development of perfect equilibrium, and it has helped to shape the modern refinement literature. Although backward induction is a cornerstone of game theory, existing empirical evidence suggests that economic agents engage in backward induction less frequently than theorists might hope.",
         "Introduction": "players in the population have these preferences that continuing the game becomes the optimal rational strategy (Aumann 1995). Similarly, there may be enough players in the population who make backward induction errors that continuing the game becomes the optimal rational strategy. Reny (1992) notes that, even if common belief of expected utility maximization holds at the initial node, it cannot hold after the first player passes, and therefore subsequent play need not conform to backward induction. That being the case, passing at the first stage can be perfectly rational. "

Historically, unconstrained robotic manipulation in board games has often proven to be more challenging than the underlying game reasoning, making it an ideal testbed for small-scale manipulation. The Gambit system includes a low-cost Kinectstyle visual sensor, a custom manipulator, and state-of-the-art learning algorithms for automatic detection and recognition of the board and objects on it. As a use-case, we describe playing chess quickly and accurately with arbitrary, uninstrumented boards and pieces, demonstrating that Gambit's engineering and design represent a new state-of-the-art in fast, robust tabletop manipulation.",
         "Introduction": "Physical board games are a rich problem domain for humanrobot cooperation research because such games have an intermediate and easily adjustable degree of structure. Playing board games involves perception of the board and game pieces, perception of the human, reasoning about the game and game state, and manipulation of the physical pieces while coordinating with the human opponent. Progress on physical board game playing systems paves the way for more general human-robot cooperation systems that assume less structure. For example, this line of work could lead eventually to a manipulator capable of helping a chemist as a lab assistant that cooperatively performs manipulation tasks in an unstructured laboratory bench-top or \"glove box\" environment."

We address one of Dreyfus's primary examples of expertise: chess. At first glance, chess would seem an obvious counterexample to Dreyfus's view since, clearly, chess experts are engaged in deep strategic thought. However, Dreyfus's argument is subtle. He accepts that analysis and deliberation play a role in chess, yet he thinks that all such thought is predicated on intuitive, arational expert perception, and action. We argue that even the so-called \"intuitive\" aspect of chess is rational through and through.",

Intrinsic quality is estimated via evaluations given by computer chess programs run to high depth, ideally so that their playing strength is sufficiently far ahead of the best human players as to be a 'relatively omniscient' guide. Several formulas, each having intrinsic skill parameters s for sensitivity and c for consistency, are argued theoretically and tested by regression on large sets of tournament games played by humans of varying strength as measured by the internationally standard Elo rating system. This establishes a correspondence between Elo rating and the parameters. A smooth correspondence is shown between statistical results and the century points on the Elo scale, and ratings are shown to have stayed quite constant over time. That is, there has been little or no 'rating inflation'. The theory and empirical results are transferable to other rationalchoice settings in which the alternatives have well-defined utilities, but in which complexity and bounded information constrain the perception of the utility values.",

Evidence that ratings have remained stable since the inception of the Elo system in the 1970's is given in several forms: by showing that the population of strong players fits a simple logistic-curve model without inflation, by plotting players' average error against the FIDE category of tournaments over time, and by skill parameters from a model that employs computer analysis keeping a nearly constant relation to Elo rating across that time. The distribution of the model's Intrinsic Performance Ratings can hence be used to compare populations that have limited interaction, such as between players in a national chess federation and FIDE, and ascertain relative drift in their respective rating systems.",
         "Introduction": "Chess players form a dynamic population of varying skills, fortunes, and aging tendencies, and participate in zero-sum contests. A numerical rating system based only on the outcomes of the contests determines everyone's place in the pecking order. There is much vested interest in the accuracy and stability of the system, with significance extending to other games besides chess and potentially wider areas. Several fundamental questions about the system lack easy answers: How accurate are the ratings? How can we judge this? Have ratings inflated over time? How can different national rating systems be compared with the FIDE system? How much variation in performance is intrinsic to a given skill level?"

This performance gain is achieved by evolving a program that mimics the behavior of a superior expert. The resulting evaluation function of the evolved program consists of a much smaller number of parameters than the expert's. The extended experimental results provided in this paper include a report on our successful participation in the 2008 World Computer Chess Championship.

The dependent variable was intellectual and socio-affective competence, which was measured by an IQ test (WISC-R), a self-report test (TAMAI) and a hetero-report questionnaire (teacher-tutor's criterion) applied at the beginning and the end of the academic year. In contrast to the comparison group, it was found that chess improves cognitive abilities, coping and problem-solving capacity, and even socioaffective development of children and adolescents who practice it. The results are modulated, particularly in the area socioaffective, by the personal profile of students who choose practice this activity.",

He contrasted this approach with brute force Minimax-like methods, based on an exhaustive search of the game tree, that aims to select the best path inside a given search horizon. Historically, the brute force approach won hands down against planning in complex games such as Chess, as the strongest Chess programs nowadays all exploit brute force algorithms. However, planning is still interesting and even necessary in some game-playing domains, for instance based on incomplete information, where there is no way to evaluate precisely or even build the game tree. In this paper we describe a technique that produced positive results in Kriegspiel, a variant of Chess played as an incomplete information game. Our main result is the definition of an algorithm for combining MonteCarlo search with planning; we tested the algorithm on a strong Kriegspiel program based on MonteCarlo search, and obtained a clear improvement.",

The evaluation function of the program is evolved by learning from databases of (human) grandmaster games. At first the organisms are evolved to mimic the behavior of human grandmasters, and then these organisms are further improved upon by means of coevolution. The search mechanism is evolved by learning from tactical test suites. Our results show that the evolved program outperforms a two-time World Computer Chess Champion, and is on a par with other leading computer chess programs.",

         "Abstract": "Since the mid 1960s, researchers in computer science have famously referred to chess as the 'drosophila' of artificial intelligence (AI). What they seem to mean by this is that chess, like the common fruit fly, is an accessible, familiar, and relatively simple experimental technology that nonetheless can be used productively to produce valid knowledge about other, more complex systems. But for historians of science and technology, the analogy between chess and drosophila assumes a larger significance. As Robert Kohler has ably described, the decision to adopt drosophila as the organism of choice for genetics research had far-reaching implications for the development of 20th century biology. In a similar manner, the decision to focus on chess as the measure of both human and computer intelligence had important and unintended consequences for AI research. This paper explores the emergence of chess as an experimental technology, its significance in the developing research practices of the AI community, and the unique ways in which the decision to focus on chess shaped the program of AI research in the decade of the 1970s. More broadly, it attempts to open up the virtual black box of computer software -and of computer games in particular -to the scrutiny of historical and sociological analysis.",
         "Introduction": "Social Studies of Science 42(1) artificial intelligence'. 1 What exactly Kronrod meant by this dramatic pronouncement is not entirely clear. In 1965 there was hardly much of a field of AI -the term itself had been invented less than a decade earlier -and there were few computers available at this time capable of playing anything resembling real chess. The M-20 computer at Kronrod's institute was one of the few that could. But Kronrod's assertion that chess was, indeed, the drosophila of AI quickly became part of the foundational lore of the discipline. The analogy was first made in print by the Nobel-prize winning economist Herbert Simon in 1973, and by the end of the decade the metaphor was appearing consistently in the literature. More recently, the 'chess as drosophila' metaphor has been extended even further to encompass both AI and cognitive science "

The low correlation between his estimates of study time and chess rating is shown to be a consequence of his methodology of relying on a couple of questions in an internet survey rather than the standard methodology in expert performance research involving a 30-minute interview tracing yearly engagement in many different practice activities.",

         "Abstract": "The increasing strength of chess engines and their fine-tuned ability to evaluate positions provide the opportunity to use computer analysis for assessing the strength of players on a move-by-move basis, as a game is being played. As each player makes a move on the board, a sufficiently strong engine will be able to determine whether that move has contributed to improve or degrade the position. This change in position evaluation is defined as the gain per move. In this article, we assume that it is possible to characterise a player by a distribution of gain over several moves, preferably across several games. We present an approach to estimate the strength of players based on their distributions of gain. This estimated strength is expressed in terms of a perceived Elo rating, which may differ from a player's actual rating. However, the average of the perceived Elo ratings is equal to the average of the actual Elo ratings for a set of players. A critical factor in the approach is the need to determine the strength of the engine used for analysis. Once this is obtained, it is possible to carry out all sorts of comparisons between players, even players from different eras who never competed against each other. There are many potential applications but here we focus mainly on developing the approach, using a few recent tournaments as well as some historical events for illustrative purposes.",
         "Introduction": "In chess, as in most other sports, the strength of players or competing teams can be estimated based on the result of games between them. However, in chess, unlike many other sports, it is possible to assess the strength of each move, at least subjectively, based on some sort of positional evaluation. In principle, by evaluating the positions on the board before and after a move was made, it is possible to assess whether the move was good or bad. Of course, straightforward approaches to position evaluation -such as summing up the value of material on the board -will not work since, for example, in the middle of a piece exchange the material may appear to be temporarily unbalanced. A position should therefore be evaluated on the basis of its potential, and this can be done by studying the main lines that arise from that position. Assuming that both players will always choose the best possible moves, the problem of evaluating a given position is recursive since it requires evaluating the new positions that can arise from the given one. Chess programs make use of a recursive algorithm known as minimax, which performs a kind of tree-based search in order to find the best move. 2 The best move has an assigned score that corresponds to the best position that can arise out of the current one, assuming that both players play best moves throughout. A more detailed explanation of how computers play chess goes beyond the scope of this work and can be found elsewhere (e.g., "

The results suggest that men play shorter games on average and pay a higher price to end the game sooner. They also perform worse in shorter game compared to women but better in longer games. Furthermore, women perform worse in time pressure (the 40 th move time control). The results are consistent with the interpretation that men are more impatient (with a lower discount factor) but also more inconsistent in the sense that they tend to be too impatient. Women, on the other hand, are more inconsistent as they tend to over-consume reflection time in the beginning, leading to time pressure later.",

Study 1 partially replicated such studies with improvements such as use of peak rating and a large, skilled sample. Number of internationally-rated games played was the strongest predictor of peak rating. Total study hours was a significant but weaker predictor. Study 2 controlled for sampling confounds by including only very well-practiced players who had played at least 350 internationally-rated games. Total study hours did not predict rating at 350 games. Study 3 found that the subjective phenomenon of reaching a performance ceiling and undertaking specific practice to get beyond it does occur but does not distinguish between stronger and weaker players. Study 4 found that many players play relatively few internationally-rated games mostly because of other commitments, such as work and education. Extensive study may go along with great interest in and persistence at chess but apparently lacks a major causative role in chess performance level.",

         "Abstract": "Composition conventions are guidelines or 'good practice' rules used by human composers in composing chess problems. They are especially important in composition tournaments or 'tourneys' (to differentiate from chess-playing tournaments). Examples of conventions include, not having any 'check' in the first move of the solution and not 'dressing up' the board with unnecessary pieces. Conventions are often associated or even directly conflated with the overall aesthetics or beauty of a composition. Using an existing experimentally-validated computational aesthetics model for three-move mate problems, we analyzed 888 computergenerated compositions adhering to at least 2 conventions and 632 adhering to at least 3 conventions to test if simply conforming to more conventions had a positive effect on their aesthetics, as is generally believed by human composers. We found slight but statistically significant evidence that it does. We also analyzed human judge scores of 145 three-move mate problems composed by humans -as human judges seldom ignore the role of composition conventions in their assessments -to see if they had any positive correlation with the computational aesthetic scores of those problems. We found that they did not. These seemingly conflicting findings suggest two main things. First, an increase in the number of 'appropriate' composition conventions (perhaps not just any of them) adhered to in a composition has a positive effect on its perceived aesthetics. Second, given the lack of any positive correlation between the human judge scores and the computational aesthetic scores, human judges either do not look at the 'appropriate' conventions related to aesthetics or emphasize others that have less to do with beauty per se, even though they may mistakenly consider their judgements 'beautiful' in the traditional, non-esoteric sense. Human judges may also be relying significantly on personal tastes which have little 'objective' aesthetic merit. Their selections are therefore no less valid, but perhaps they have less to do with beauty than previously assumed.",
         "Introduction": "A chess problem or 'composition' is a type of puzzle typically created by a human composer using a chess set. It presents potential solvers with a stipulation, e.g. White to play and mate in 3 moves, and is usually composed with aesthetics or beauty in mind. Compositions often adhere to many 'composition conventions' as well."

The results indicated that chess player students showed more achievement in both meta-cognitive abilities and mathematical problem solving capabilities than other non-chess player students.

Learning how to solve a problem is probably more important than finding a solution for a specific problem. By means of chess, we learn how to evaluate a context and to this end, we should concentrate on the main factors and omit diversions. We may find original and imaginative solutions to accomplish the plan. Chess is very influential, since it is self-motivating.

The research question, How do women experience and describe organizational discourse? formed the basis of inquiry into women's perceptions of how their discourse is accepted, valued, and acted upon within organizations and whether prevalent discourse patterns prevent women from engaging in strategic conversations and processes, which may affect women's professional development. Eleven female, midlevel or executive level managers in various organizations were interviewed individually. The overarching research method was narrative analysis supported through hermeneutics/interpretive analysis, content analysis, and thematic analysis. The study's purpose was to explore how implicit gendering of organizational discourse creates, maintains, and perpetuates male-gendered organizations and the glass-ceiling and to uncover implications for organization strategy. Findings showed women's discourse of helping, comradeship, and personal attributes including ability and expertise as undervalued, disregarded, and unrecognized within hegemonic, hierarchical organizations.

         "Abstract": "Cheating in chess can take many forms and has existed almost as long as the game itself. The advent of computers has introduced a new form of cheating into the game. Thanks to the computational power of modern-day computers, a player can use a program to calculate thousands of moves for him or her, and determine the best possible scenario for each move and countermove. These programs are often referred to as \"bots,\" and can even play the game without any user interaction. In this paper, we describe a methodology aimed at preventing bots from participating in online chess games. The proposed approach is based on the integration of a CAPTCHA protocol into a game scenario, and the subsequent inability of bots to accurately track the game states. This is achieved by rotating the images of the individual chess pieces and adjusting their resolution in an attempt to render them unreadable by a bot. Feedback from users during testing shows that there is minimal impact on their ability to play the game. Players rated the difficulty of reading the pieces on a scale of one to ten, with an average rank of 6.5. However, the average number of moves to adjust to the distorted pieces was only 3.75. This tells us that, although it is difficult to read the pieces at first, it is easy to adjust quickly to the new image.",

Our study examines the role of slow deliberation for experts who exhibit superior decision-making outcomes in tactical chess problems with clear best moves. Our study uses advanced computer software to measure the objective value of actions preferred at the start versus the conclusion of decision making. It finds that both experts and less skilled individuals benefit significantly from extra deliberation regardless of whether the problem is easy or difficult.

We introduce the Information Capture And ReUse Strategy (ICARUS) framework for describing and combining such enhancements. We demonstrate the ICARUS framework's usefulness as a frame of reference for understanding existing enhancements, combining them, and designing new ones. We also use ICARUS to adapt some well-known MCTS enhancements (originally designed for games of perfect information) to handle information asymmetry between players and randomness, features which can make decision-making much more difficult. We also introduce a new enhancement designed within the ICARUS framework, EPisodic Information Capture and reuse (EPIC), designed to exploit the episodic nature of many games. Empirically we demonstrate that EPIC is stronger and more robust than existing enhancements in a variety of game domains, thus validating ICARUS as a powerful tool for enhancement design within MCTS.",

In the early days of computer science it was a topic for specialists. But as computers were democratized, and the strength of chess engines began to increase, chess players started to appropriate to themselves these new tools. We show how these interactions between the world of chess and information technologies have been herald of broader social impacts of information technologies. The game of chess, and more broadly the world of chess (chess players, literature, computer softwares and websites dedicated to chess, etc.), turns out to be a surprisingly and particularly sharp indicator of the changes induced in our everyday life by the information technologies. Moreover, in the same way that chess is a modelization of war that captures the raw features of strategic thinking, chess world can be seen as small society making the study of the information technologies impact easier to analyze and to grasp.",

         "Abstract": "The complexity of chess matches has attracted broad interest since its invention. This complexity and the availability of large number of recorded matches make chess an ideal model systems for the study of population-level learning of a complex system. We systematically investigate the move-bymove dynamics of the white player's advantage from over seventy thousand high level chess matches spanning over 150 years. We find that the average advantage of the white player is positive and that it has been increasing over time. Currently, the average advantage of the white player is \u223c0.17 pawns but it is exponentially approaching a value of 0.23 pawns with a characteristic time scale of 67 years. We also study the diffusion of the move dependence of the white player's advantage and find that it is non-Gaussian, has long-ranged anti-correlations and that after an initial period with no diffusion it becomes super-diffusive. We find that the duration of the non-diffusive period, corresponding to the opening stage of a match, is increasing in length and exponentially approaching a value of 15.6 moves with a characteristic time scale of 130 years. We interpret these two trends as a resulting from learning of the features of the game. Additionally, we find that the exponent \u03b1 characterizing the super-diffusive regime is increasing toward a value of 1.9, close to the ballistic regime. We suggest that this trend is due to the increased broadening of the range of abilities of chess players participating in major tournaments.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not chess training for six-year-old children would affect the development of spatial concepts such as forward-backward, between -next to, in front -behind, diagonal, far -near, corner, pattern and symmetry and whether or not there are differences according to child gender. Subjects were 50 children who had previously taken chess courses and 50 children who had not taken chess courses. A group of 100 six-year-old children was given a concept test. A test containing the concepts used in chess instruction and a chess board to be used in applying the test were developed by the researcher. After the obtained data were analysed, K-R 20 \u00bc 0.92 was found for the concept test. The Mann -Whitney U test, based on the children's scores t from the concept test, revealed a statistically meaningful difference in all concepts in favour of the children who took chess courses, but showed no meaningful gender differences for any of the concepts.",

The specialized literature reports several works in which the weights of the positional values of the chess pieces are evolved based on values stored in tables. Here, however, we propose to use a neural network architecture to obtain the positional values of the chess pieces based on specific features of each position. The neural networks that we adopt for this sake are relatively small and we argue that they constitute a robust way of obtaining the positional values of the chess pieces. The adjustment of weights of such neural networks was done through the use of an evolutionary algorithm, producing an increase of 433 points of the ranking of our chess engine (from 1745 to 2178 points, reaching a value close to that of a chessmaster).",

We also introduce here the use of a local search scheme based on the Hooke-Jeeves algorithm, which is adopted to adjust the weights of the best virtual player obtained in the evolutionary process. As our results indicate, this produced a further improvement in the rating of our chess engine.

         "Introduction": "The first major issue that must be addressed when we start to write a chess program is how to represent the chessboard and other supporting data structures that will be used in different parts of a chess engine. This primary decision, which is very often based on incomplete or insufficient information, has its consequences later, when we come to the main chess engine procedures like move generator or evaluator. At that point, one could discover that his data structures have some fundamental shortcomings and could not satisfy expectations about the efficiency or programming facility. Sometimes, these deficiencies can appear at the end of the development cycle when the engine is ported on some specific hardware platform. Such a revelation can be very unpleasant for the programmer because, at this stage, re-design of the basic data structure is not viable option anymore. Our intention, throughout this paper, is to present all relevant information about existing data structures in order to help even inexperienced chess engine programmers to properly select the basic data structure.

However, we do not understand how experts process degradation or distortion of stimuli within the expert domain (e.g., a face with the eyes, nose, and mouth in the wrong positions, or a chessboard with pieces placed randomly). Focusing on the domain of chess, we present new fMRI evidence that when experts view such distorted/within-domain stimuli, they engage an active search for structure-a kind of exploratory chunking-that involves a component of a prefrontal-parietal network linked to consciousness, attention and working memory.",

We use a large international panel dataset on high-level chess competitions which includes a control for the players' skill in chess. This data is combined with results from a survey on an online labor market where participants were asked to rate the photos of 626 expert chess players according to attractiveness. Our results suggest that male chess players choose significantly riskier strategies when playing against an attractive female opponent, even though this does not improve their performance. Women's strategies are not affected by the attractiveness of the opponent.",
         "Introduction": "Risk preferences are typically studied from situations in which individuals make decisions in isolation. In many instances, however, one individual's risk taking has consequences on the outcome of another individual, as in the case of competitions where decisions involve risk. To what extent characteristics of one individual affect risk taking by another individual is relatively unexplored. In particular, little is known about the role of physical traits on risk taking. In this paper we focus on attractiveness. In practice, it can be hard to get reliable data on outcomes regarding risk and attractiveness. Options as well as outcomes are not always easily defined when decisions are made outside of the laboratory, and as Eckel and Wilson  (2004) discuss, physical appearance could be used as a heuristic when people try to form an opinion about an unfamiliar individual's ability and characteristics. It can therefore be a challenge to disentangle attractiveness from for example beliefs about ability. We argue that the data used in this paper enables us to disentangle the specific effect of attractiveness on risk taking, by allowing us to study relevant outcome variables while controlling for aspects such as ability. Such information is publicly available, which means that the subjects studied in this study do not have to use attractiveness as a proxy for another individual's ability."

In Trap A B , we define two basic components: 1) defining a trap by considering the nature of alpha-beta search algorithm and referring the evaluation value returned by iterative deepening; and 2) evaluating a trap by calculating the probability that the opponent fall into the trap and the advantage followed when the opponent fall into it. In our experiment, we test the performance of Trap A B in comparison with three game-tree search algorithms, i.e., min-max, trappy minimax, and alpha-beta, by playing with four testing opponents (their depthes are 7, 8, 9, and 10 respectively), which are obtained form a typical Chinese chess computer game programme-Xqwizard (",

The interrelations of pieces in a chess game represent complex and evolving networks that describe both tactical and strategic elements of the game. Even when a chess game is represented as a network of interrelations among the pieces, abstracting away all of the specifics and details of the game, such as the value of pieces or the notion of the board \"center,\" the network still contains valuable information about the game played, when the critical moments are, and what the likely outcome will be. By representing a game as a series of networks, each modeling a different aspect of the connections among the pieces and the board, even richer information is available. By additionally considering the evolution of the graphs as a time series through the course of the game, still more information can be gathered. With only minimal encoding of game rules and logic, this series of evolving graphs is able to capture with surprising fidelity the evaluation of the game. In this paper we examine the information that can be extracted from the evolution of these networks and show that their predictive power surpasses that of an evaluation function that directly employs the rules and strategies of chess.",

         "Abstract": "How deep does a chess Grandmaster think? This question has been asked many times, and yet there is hardly a definite answer. Raw depth and pure calculation are certainly not the only factors in the thinking process of a chess player, but it would be interesting to know more about the relationship between search depth and playing strength, so that the strength of a given player (which is usually expressed in terms of an Elo rating) can be said to correspond to a certain equivalent depth (of some given engine). Since the thinking depth of a human player is difficult to determine, we carry out an experiment with a chess engine running at different search depths in order to obtain an average score that can be translated into a rating difference in the Elo scale. However, knowing the rating difference is not sufficient; we need have at least one value of engine depth for which the corresponding Elo rating has been estimated, so that the Elo ratings for other values of search depth can also be determined. In order to obtain the Elo rating that corresponds to HOUDINI 1.5a 64-bit running at a fixed iteration depth of 20 plies, we carry out an analysis of the quality of play at the Candidates Tournament 2013. From these results, we show how the search depth of that particular engine correlates with the Elo ratings of human players. The paper also discusses related work on self-play experiments and the effect of diminishing returns, which becomes apparent in our experiment.",

This strong claim is opposed with the current body of evidence on the relevance of intelligence for expert performance in the prototypical expertise domain of chess. Although the findings are not unequivocal, presumably due to methodological aspects, several studies employing psychometric tests of intelligence have revealed that expert chess players display significantly higher intelligence than controls and that their playing strength is related to their intelligence level. In addition, by using the extended expert-novice paradigm (comparing experts with novices of different intelligence levels) it has been found that both, expertise and intelligence impact on the performance in expertise-related tasks. These studies suggest that expert chess play does not stand in isolation from intelligence and could stimulate interdisciplinary research on the role of general cognitive abilities in expertise development.",

The algorithm stores and then reuses chains or sequences of moves, built up from previous searches. These move sequences have a built-in forward-pruning mechanism that can radically reduce the search space. A typical search process might retrieve a move from a Transposition Table , \nwhere the decision of what move to retrieve would be based on the position itself. This algorithm stores move sequences based on what previous sequences were better, or caused cutoffs. This is therefore position independent and so it could also be useful in games with imperfect information or uncertainty, where the whole situation is not known at any one time. Over a small set of tests, the algorithm was shown to clearly out-perform Transposition Tables, both in terms of search reduction and game-play results.",

The context is to optimise the search process for the game of computer chess.

We evaluate the 'health' of a game position from a Systems perspective, using a dynamic model of the interaction of the pieces. The identification and management of stressors and the construction of resilient positions allow effective postponements for less-promising game continuations due to the perceived presence of adaptive capacity and sustainable development. We calculate and maintain a database of potential mobility for each chess piece 3 moves into the future, for each position we evaluate. We determine the likely restrictions placed on the future mobility of the pieces based on the attack paths of the lower-valued enemy pieces. Knowledge is derived from Foucault's and Znosko-Borovsky's conceptions of dynamic power relations. We develop coherent strategic scenarios based on guidance obtained from the vital Vickers/Bossel/Max-Neef diagnostic indicators.

Chess is one of the most complex strategy games, where expert contenders exercise decision making by imitating old games or introducing innovations. In this work, we study innovation in chess by analyzing how different move sequences are played at the population level. It is found that the probability of exploring a new or innovative move decreases as a power law with the frequency of the preceding move sequence. Chess players also exploit already known move sequences according to their frequencies, following a preferential growth mechanism. Furthermore, innovation in chess exhibits Heaps' law suggesting similarities with the process of vocabulary growth. We propose a robust generative mechanism based on nested Yule-Simon preferential growth processes that reproduces the empirical observations. These results, supporting the self-similar nature of innovations in chess are important in the context of decision making in a competitive scenario, and extend the scope of relevant findings recently discovered regarding the emergence of Zipf 's law in chess.",

         "Abstract": "This article presents a case study application of Hiller's (2011) Multi -Layered Chronological Chart (MLCC) methodology to the life story of former World Chess Champion Bobby Fischer. Designed for use in qualitative biographical studies, the MLCC is adapted here for psychobiographical research. In 1972, Fischer became an American Cold War hero as he wrestled the World Chess Championship from a half century of Soviet domination. His rapid rise to world fame was followed by infamy as Fischer abandoned competitive chess, grew increasingly Anti -Semitic and Anti -American, became a fugitive from U.S. justice, and died in relative isolation in Reykjavik, Iceland. Fischer remains one of the more enigmatic personalities of the 20th century and many questions remain regarding his psychological health. The MLCC method is used to contextualize Fischer's life in nine key topical domains across five developmental life stages. The value of the MLCC methodology to psychobiographical research is highlighted and suggestions for advancing this methodology are put forth.",

         "Abstract": "Robert (Bobby) James Fischer  remains one of the most puzzling and enigmatic personalities in modern American history. In 1972, at the height of Cold War tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States, Bobby Fischer defeated Soviet Boris Spassky to become the first official world chess champion from the United States. Two decades later, after playing a rematch with Spassky in war-torn Yugoslavia, Fischer became a fugitive from U.S. justice. Although always an independent, autonomous, and forthright person, Fischer's behavior after the 1972 championship grew increasingly strange and bizarre. \"Who was Bobby Fischer and what happened to him\" is a lingering question that has not been adequately answered by psychologists, historians, and biographers. The present article examines the life of Bobby Fischer from three diverse psychobiographical lenses: Erikson's ",

Data from 12 scholastic chess tournaments indicated that females performed worse than expected when playing against a male opponent, achieving 83% of the expected success based on their own and their opponent's prerating. These effects were strongest for the youngest players in lower elementary school but also present for those in upper elementary. Stereotype threat susceptibility was most pronounced in contexts that could be considered challenging: when playing a strong or moderate opponent and when playing someone in a higher or the same grade. As evidence of disengagement, those most vulnerable to stereotype threat were less likely to continue playing in future chess tournaments. These results were not found in a matched comparison male group suggesting the outcomes were unique to stereotype threat and not universal to young chess players.",

We used two mapping rules to build discrete time series and analyzed them using two methods for detecting long-range correlations; rescaled range analysis and detrended fluctuation analysis. We found that long-range memory is related to the level of the players. When the database is filtered according to player levels we found differences in the persistence of the different subsets. For high level players, correlations are stronger at long time scales; whereas in intermediate and low level players they reach the maximum value at shorter time scales. This can be interpreted as a signature of the different strategies used by players with different levels of expertise. These results are robust against the assignation rules and the method employed in the analysis of the time series.",

         "Abstract": "In a wide range of problem-solving settings, the presence of a familiar solution can block the discovery of better solutions (i.e., the Einstellung effect). To investigate this effect, we monitored the eye movements of expert and novice chess players while they solved chess problems that contained a familiar move (i.e., the Einstellung move), as well as an optimal move that was located in a different region of the board. When the Einstellung move was an advantageous (but suboptimal) move, both the expert and novice chess players who chose the Einstellung move continued to look at this move throughout the trial, whereas the subset of expert players who chose the optimal move were able to gradually disengage their attention from the Einstellung move. However, when the Einstellung move was a blunder, all of the experts and the majority of the novices were able to avoid selecting the Einstellung move, and both the experts and novices gradually disengaged their attention from the Einstellung move. These findings shed light on the boundary conditions of the Einstellung effect, and provide convergent evidence for Bilalic \u00b4, McLeod, & Gobet (2008)'s conclusion that the Einstellung effect operates by biasing attention towards problem features that are associated with the familiar solution rather than the optimal solution.",

Experimental results show that the multimodal integration of head direction information with facial expressions displayed by the user improves the recognition of the user's affective states.",

Most of the previous work in this area has normally adopted co-evolution (i.e., tournaments among virtual players) to decide which players will pass to the following generation, depending on the outcome of each game. In contrast, our proposed method uses evolution to decide which virtual players will pass to the next generation based on the number of positions solved from a number of chess grandmaster games. Using a search depth of 1-ply, our method can solve 40.78% of the positions evaluated from chess grandmaster games (this value is higher than the one reported in the previous related work). Additionally, our method is capable of solving 53.08% of the positions using a historical mechanism that keeps a record of the \"good\" virtual players found during the evolutionary process. Our proposal has also been able to increase the competition level of our search engine, when playing against the program Chessmaster (grandmaster edition). Our chess engine reached a rating of 2404 points for the best virtual player with supervised learning, and a rating of 2442 points for the best virtual player with unsupervised learning. Finally, it is also worth mentioning that our results indicate that the piece material values obtained by our approach are similar to the values known from chess theory.",

One of the reasons is that most of the studies investigated only one factor (e.g., intelligence), neglecting other factors relevant for the acquisition of chess skill (e.g., amount of practice, years of experience). The present study investigated the chess skill of 57 young chess players using measures of intelligence (WISC III), practice, and experience. Although practice had the most influence on chess skill, intelligence explained some variance even after the inclusion of practice. When an elite subsample of 23 children was tested, it turned out that intelligence was not a significant factor in chess skill, and that, if anything, it tended to correlate negatively with chess skill. This unexpected result is explained by a negative correlation between intelligence and practice in the elite subsample. The study demonstrates the dangers of focusing on a single factor in complex real-world situations where a number of closely interconnected factors operate.",

         "Abstract": "In June 2011, the International Computer Games Association (ICGA) disqualified Vasik Rajlich and his Rybka chess program for plagiarism and breaking their rules on originality in their events from 2006 to 2010. One primary basis for this came from a painstaking code comparison, using the source code of Fruit and the object code of Rybka, which found the selection of evaluation features in the programs to be almost the same, much more than expected by chance.",
         "Introduction": "Computer chess has seen a number of derivative programs over the years. One of the first was the incident in the 1989 World Microcomputer Chess Championship (WMCCC), in which Quickstep was disqualified due to the program being ''a copy of the program Mephisto Almeria'' in all important areas. See ICCA Journal 12/4. The conclusion here was rather clear, and left little room for contention; later cases would not always be so easy."

Netanyahu Member, IEEE Abstract-This paper demonstrates the use of genetic algorithms for evolving: 1) a grandmaster-level evaluation function, and 2) a search mechanism for a chess program, the parameter values of which are initialized randomly. The evaluation function of the program is evolved by learning from databases of (human) grandmaster games. At first, the organisms are evolved to mimic the behavior of human grandmasters, and then these organisms are further improved upon by means of coevolution. The search mechanism is evolved by learning from tactical test suites. Our results show that the evolved program outperforms a two-time world computer chess champion and is at par with the other leading computer chess programs."

It defines a trap as a move that looks good at a shallow search depth, but is revealed to be in fact a bad move, when analyzed at a greater search depth. The algorithm utilizes information accumulated during iterative deepening, and then rewards moves that lead to traps. The reward mechanism often causes the computer to select moves that normal minimax considers inferior, because minimax assumes that the opponent always makes the best response, whereas trappy minimax identifies those inferior moves that an opponent might be tempted to play. The algorithm challenges the fundamental notion of \"best move\", as shown in examples from actual games. Trappy minimax is tested in the game of chess by incorporating it into the Beowulf chess engine. The trappy version of Beowulf earned a significantly higher rating on ICC than did normal Beowulf, against human opponents, but not against other computers. The results illuminate a number of advantages for not always assuming best opponent response.",
         "Introduction": "At the core of nearly all computer board game play is the minimax algorithm. And at the core of minimax is the assumption that searching for the best available move necessitates assuming that the opponent will also make the best response. While there is no denying the competitive success of this tenet, it carries with it several implications deserving of further consideration."

In this response, I argue (a) that Ericsson drew a biased picture of the research findings by using a very conservative definition of expert performance, (b) that Ericsson's main alternative explanation of the research findings in the domain of chess, i.e., selection processes in the access to training opportunities, is speculative and implausible, and (c) that central evidence from the extended expert-novice paradigm has not been considered in his review. Future research on the relation and interplay between general cognitive abilities and expertise needs to go beyond theories and methods of the expert-performance framework.",

We carried out empirical experiments by using state-of-the-art chess-program Crafty as the base program.

The present study tested the power law's generality to development over many years of a very complex cognitive skill, chess playing, with 387 skilled participants, most of whom were grandmasters. A power or logarithmic function best fit grouped data but individuals showed much variability. An exponential function usually was the worst fit to individual data. Groups differing in chess talent were compared and a power function best fit the group curve for the more talented players while a quadratic function best fit that for the less talented. After extreme amounts of practice, a logarithmic function best fit grouped data but a quadratic function best fit most individual curves. Individual variability is great and the power law or an exponential law are not the best descriptions of individual chess skill development.",
         "Introduction": "Extensive practice can greatly improve skilled performance and a key concern in several fields is the form of the resulting learning curve. What function best interrelates performance and extent of practice?

In order to guide my examination I bring mainly Bauman's thoughts about Ambivalence and Order and Alfredo Veiga-Neto's statements about Discipline and Control to take a closer look at the so called modern and post modern individuals' perceptions about Space and Time, as well Egon Carli Klein's research to make a short consideration about Strategy and Gambling Games.",

Most discourses sound quite pessimistic or even much harder about the modernism than I allow myself to understand. A scene from the computer game called \"Chessmaster 2000\" [ 3 ] is one of the first images that come to my mind when I come across such discourses. I used to play \"Chessmaster 2000\" in the early 1990s and always enjoyed the battle scenes that this computer game was able to perform whenever a piece was about to be removed from the game. Other computer chess games at the same time were limited to replace a piece with the winner one at the same spot imitating the melancholy of the modern version of the chess game."

It is implied that expert representation is less anchored by spatial (Euclidean) proximity and may instead be dictated by the intrinsic relation in the structure and grammar of the specific domain of expertise. Here we set out to examine this hypothesis. We used the domain of chess which has been widely used as a tool to study human expertise. We reasoned that the movement of an opponent piece to a specific square constitutes an external cue and the reaction of the player to this \"perturbation\" should reveal his internal representation of proximity. We hypothesized that novice players will tend to respond by moving a piece in closer squares than experts. Similarly, but now in terms of object representations, we hypothesized weak players will more likely focus on a specific piece and hence produce sequence of actions repeating movements of the same piece. We capitalized on a large corpus of data obtained from internet chess servers. Results showed that, relative to experts, weaker players tend to (1) produce consecutive moves in proximal board locations, (2) move more often the same piece and (3) reduce the number of remaining pieces more rapidly, most likely to decrease cognitive load and mental effort. These three principles might reflect the effect of expertise on human actions in complex setups.",

         "Abstract": "Consider the chess game: When faced with a complex scenario, how does understanding arise in one's mind? How does one integrate disparate cues into a global, meaningful whole? How do players avoid the combinatorial explosion? How are abstract ideas represented? The purpose of this paper is to propose a new computational model of human chess cognition. We suggest that analogies and abstract roles are crucial to understanding a chess scenario. We present a proof-of-concept model, in the form of a computational architecture, which accounts for many crucial aspects of human play, such as (i) concentration of attention to relevant aspects, (ii) how humans may avoid the combinatorial explosion, (iii) perception of similarity at a strategic level, (iv) a state of meaningful anticipation over how a global scenario may evolve, and (v) the architecture's choice as an emergent phenomenon from the actions of subcognitive processes.",
         "Introduction": "Most models of decision-making and strategic thinking are based on game-theoretical ideas. Yet, the human mind works in different ways from those postulated by game theory or expected utility theory. While game theory has provided us with valuable insights into numerous scientific fields, the assumption that humans think and act ''rationally'' as postulated does not stand empirical enquiry "

Such methods can be applied to several very different types of chess problems. These problems range from the analysis of chess endgames to so-called \"classical retrograde chess problems\" that are designed especially for retrograde analysis. So, chess problems in which retrograde analysis can be applied are often mutually so different that we can say that they belong to different domains.

Its importance rests on the assumption that it affects the outcome of the game. The rationale for this assumption is that in the opening both white and black attempt to deploy their pieces and simultaneously to occupy and control the four empty squares in the middle of the board and the party that gets ahead in achieving these goals enjoys a higher probability of winning the game ceteris paribus "

         "Introduction": "HESS is a game with deep historical origins dating back as far as the 6th century AD, and first version of the game emerged in India under the name of Chaturanga. Then the game quickly spread to Persia and subsequently the Arab world. Eventually spread to Europe. Although the game is thought to have differed widely from the game we play today, around the end of the 15th century many of the chessmen developed their modern powers, enhancing the speed and dynamics of the game and creating the game we play now. At the beginning of each game the chessboard is set up in the initial position. Each player begins with 8 pieces (1 King, 1 Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops and 2 Knights) and 8 pawns which are located in their respective positions. Knot theory deals with knots, links, braids, and related objects. It is a branch of algebraic topology which started in the late 1880's. The scotch mathematician, Lord William Thomson , proposed that different elements consists of different configurations of knots. He described atoms to be knots in the fabric of this ether. This theory led many Scientists to believe that we could understand the chemical elements by simply studying different types of knots and thus this led to a completely new field of study in Mathematics .One of the most important applications of the knot theory arises in study of DNA "

         "Introduction": "Many students in the United States participate in after-school chess clubs. While students join chess clubs for competitive play, there is a growing trend to develop and implement scholastic chess curriculum that targets students' academic outcomes through after-school and in-school initiatives. Scholastic chess instruction uses chess as a springboard to work on cognitive and academic skills that are critical to student performance, such as logical and spatial thinking, reasoning, long-term planning, assessment, decision-making, memory, judgment, and strategizing. The research base that explores whether chess programs impact student cognitive, academic, and behavioral outcomes is growing. The over-arching goal of this literature review is to identify the degree to which existing empirical evidence supports the theory that participation in chess programs, whether designed as in-school or after-school programs, will lead to improved academic, cognitive, and/or behavioral outcomes for school-aged children. This literature review identified 51 studies of chess. Twenty-four of the 51 studies met a set of pre-determined criteria for eligibility and were included in analyses. Results from the literature review were categorized by the quality of the study design and organized by whether the studies examined after-school or in-school chess programs.

Responsibility judgments were collected in seven samples of lay people and experts before, during, and after the World Chess Championship in 2013. Participants assessed the responsibility of the two players, their supporting teams, local conditions, and chance factors for four hypothetical outcomes (large and small loss/win for each player), along with probabilities for these outcomes, demonstrating subadditivity (sums exceeding 100%) in all samples, even among chess experts. The winner was consistently perceived to be more responsible than the loser, and more for outcomes with large than small margins. There was also an effect of focal player, as Carlsen was given more responsibility both for losses and wins than Anand, by the present (Norwegian) pro-Carlsen samples. However, this effect could be modified by describing the outcomes as Anand's (rather than Carlsen's) wins and losses. Thus the study adds to the valence framing literature by showing how responsibility judgments are affected by the way outcomes are framed.",

Since the very beginning of computer science, the challenge of being able to program a computer capable of playing chess and beating humans has been alive and used both as a mark to measure hardware/software progresses and as an ongoing programming challenge leading to numerous discoveries. In the early days of computer science it was a topic for specialists. But as computers were democratized, and the strength of chess engines began to increase, chess players started to appropriate to themselves these new tools. We show how these interactions between the world of chess and information technologies have been herald of broader social impacts of information technologies. The game of chess, and more broadly the world of chess (chess players, literature, computer softwares and websites dedicated to chess, etc.), turns out to be a surprisingly and particularly sharp indicator of the changes induced in our everyday life by the information technologies. Moreover, in the same way that chess is a modelization of war that captures the raw features of strategic thinking, chess world can be seen as small society making the study of the information technologies impact easier to analyze and to grasp.",

Finally, the world of chess is smaller than the real society. In the same way than chess captures the essence of strategic thinking in a concise and formalized way, the world of chess can be seen as a miniature version of society making it much easier to grasp and analyze."

These effects were strongest for the youngest players in lower elementary school but also present for those in upper elementary. Stereotype threat susceptibility was most pronounced in contexts that could be considered challenging: when playing a strong or moderate opponent and when playing someone in a higher or the same grade. As evidence of disengagement, those most vulnerable to stereotype threat were less likely to continue playing in future chess tournaments. These results were not found in a matched comparison male group suggesting the outcomes were unique to stereotype threat and not universal to young chess players.",

For this purpose, the Game Description Language (GDL) has been developed as a high-level knowledge representation formalism to communicate game rules to players. In this paper, we address a fundamental limitation of state-of-the-art methods and systems for General Game Playing, namely, their being confined to deterministic games with complete information about the game state. We develop a simple yet expressive extension of standard GDL that allows for formalising the rules of arbitrary finite, n-player games with randomness and incomplete state knowledge. In the second part of the paper, we address the intricate reasoning challenge for general game-playing systems that comes with the new description language. We develop a full embedding of extended GDL into the Situation Calculus augmented by Scherl and Levesque's knowledge fluent . We formally prove that this provides a sound and complete reasoning method for players' knowledge about game states as well as about the knowledge of the other players.",

         "Abstract": "Trappy minimax is a modification to minimax that attempts to identify and set traps in two-player strategy games. It defines a trap as a move that looks good at a shallow search depth, but is revealed to be in fact a bad move, when analyzed at a greater search depth. The algorithm utilizes information accumulated during iterative deepening, and then rewards moves that lead to traps. The reward mechanism often causes the computer to select moves that normal minimax considers inferior, because minimax assumes that the opponent always makes the best response, whereas trappy minimax identifies those inferior moves that an opponent might be tempted to play. The algorithm challenges the fundamental notion of \"best move\", as shown in examples from actual games. Trappy minimax is tested in the game of chess by incorporating it into the Beowulf chess engine. The trappy version of Beowulf earned a significantly higher rating on ICC than did normal Beowulf, against human opponents, but not against other computers. The results illuminate a number of advantages for not always assuming best opponent response.",
         "Introduction": "At the core of nearly all computer board game play is the minimax algorithm. And at the core of minimax is the assumption that searching for the best available move necessitates assuming that the opponent will also make the best response. While there is no denying the competitive success of this tenet, it carries with it several implications deserving of further consideration."

Accordingly, we monitored the eye movements of expert and novice chess players, while they selected white's best move for a variety of chess problems. To manipulate relevancy, we constructed two different versions of each chess problem in the experiment, and we counterbalanced these versions across participants. These two versions of each problem were identical except that a single piece was changed from a bishop to a knight. This subtle change reversed the relevancy map of the board, such that regions that were relevant in one version of the board were now irrelevant (and vice versa). Using this paradigm, we demonstrated that both the experts and novices spent more time fixating the relevant relative to the irrelevant regions of the board. However, the experts were faster at detecting relevant information than the novices, as shown by the finding that experts (but not novices) were able to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information during the early part of the trial. These findings further demonstrate the domain-related perceptual processing advantage of chess experts, using an experimental paradigm that allowed us to manipulate relevancy under tightly controlled conditions.",

         "Abstract": "Mahjong 1 is the quintessential Chinese game. It is played with 144 tiles and each game has 16 rounds. Opportunities for cheating abound during each round of play. Video recording is the traditional method for preventing cheating, but it has significant flaws. These deficiencies are overcome by the Anti-swindle Mahjong Leisure System (AMLPS) which uses mature RFID technology and employs ontology to capture Mahjong playing knowledge from a focus group. Unlike current non-IT-based Mahjong systems, AMLPS has computing capabilities which make it applicable to other games such as bridge or chess. AMLPS has proven to be unique in the field of Mahjong games; it has two patents registered with Taiwan's Intellectual Property Office. The low cost of AMLPS gives it significant potential market value.",
         "Introduction": "Games are fun, but cheating can ruin an otherwise pleasant activity. Mahjong is the traditional game with the widest reach in greater Chinas. The rules of the game vary by province, but they all have similarities. Commonly, each game has 16 rounds. Cheating may occur because the human brain has difficulty memorizing the tile discarding sequence or remembering the course of play after the game has finished. Most previous technology designed for Mahjong focused on improving the Mahjong tiles or the table's mechanical structure. According to a publication by Taiwan's Intellectual Property Office (www.tipo.gov.tw), neither cheating prevention nor analytical records are addressed in the existing technologies or facilities relating to Mahjong. The motivation of this study is clear: Chinese society makes up one fourth of the world's population, and since Mahjong is so widely played, we believe there is a real need to develop an AMLPS which can prevent from cheating, record the process and perform analysis. The proposed AMLPS uses mature RFID technology as the interface for identifying Mahjong tiles, and uses ontology theory to capture Mahjong playing knowledge from a focus group."

         "Abstract": "The Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) is of utmost importance for comparing evolutionary algorithms as the performance of one algorithm over another can be scientifically proven. However, NHST is often misused, improperly applied and misinterpreted. In order to avoid the pitfalls of NHST usage this paper proposes a new method, a Chess Rating System for Evolutionary Algorithms (CRS4EAs) for the comparison and ranking of evolutionary algorithms. A computational experiment in CRS4EAs is conducted in the form of a tournament where the evolutionary algorithms are treated as chess players and a comparison between the solutions of two algorithms on the objective function is treated as one game outcome. The rating system used in CRS4EAs was inspired by the Glicko-2 rating system, based on the Bradley-Terry model for dynamic pairwise comparisons, where each algorithm is represented by rating, rating deviation, a rating/confidence interval, and rating volatility. The CRS4EAs was empirically compared to NHST within a computational experiment conducted on 16 evolutionary algorithms and a benchmark suite of 20 numerical minimisation problems. The analysis of the results shows that the CRS4EAs is comparable with NHST but may also have many additional benefits. The computations in CRS4EAs are less complicated and sensitive than those in statistical significance tests, the method is less sensitive to outliers, reliable ratings can be obtained over a small number of runs, and the conservativity/liberality of CRS4EAs is easier to control.",

The current study investigated the contribution of practice, IQ and motivation to chess performance prospectively in a group of young, novice chess players in which IQ restriction of range did not play a role. Children who entered their first chess course were asked to complete weekly diaries indicating the amount of practice and their enjoyment of the course. IQ and motivation were measured using standardized tests. Using path analysis, we found that IQ and practice independently predicted chess performance on a chess test at the end of the course. Motivation influenced performance indirectly, by moderating the amount of practice that was undertaken.

Being multipolar, this world will inevitably lead to frictions where civilizations and states will have to decide whether to risk conflict. Very often these decisions are informed if not taken by experts. To estimate risk-taking across civilizations, we examined strategies used in 667,617 chess games played over ten years by chess experts from 12 different civilizations. We show that some civilizations are more inclined to settle for peace. Similarly, we show that once engaged in the battle, the level of risk taking varies significantly across civilizations, the boldest civilization using the riskiest strategy about 35% more than the most conservative civilization. We discuss which psychological factors might underpin these civilizational differences.",

Those techniques include (1) extraction of chess moves from an image of printed page, (2) recognition of chess moves from the extracted image, and (3) displaying digitally encoded successive moves as an animation on a chessboard. Since all the moves are temporally related, temporal animations show change of spatial patterns in time. Moreover, it becomes easier to understand how the moves are played out and who leads the game. In this study, we animate chess moves printed in Figurine Algebraic Notation (FAN) notation. The proposed technique also eliminates false recognition by means of controlling possible moves in accordance with the rules of chess semantics.",
         "Introduction": "Pattern recognition has been studied in many fields including psychology, psychiatry, biometrics, bioinformatics and gene expression analysis, cognitive science, traffic flow, handwriting recognition in criminology and banking, optical character recognition (OCR), computational finance, stock markets and many more. OCR systems are divided into two categories: (i) task-specific systems and (ii) general purpose systems. In task-specific systems, whole document is considered to be text, and certain portions of a document are digitized. This approach is widely used in bank check readers, account processing systems, and airline ticketing readers. In general purpose OCR systems, the document is separated as text and non-text blocks. Text blocks are split into lines, words, and characters. These systems are known as document image analysis "

         "Abstract": "We introduce a new artificial intelligence (AI) approach or technique termed, the 'Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate' (DSNS). This technique uses selected attributes from objects in various domains (e.g. chess problems, classical music, renowned artworks) and recombines them in such a way as to generate new attributes that can then, in principle, be used to create novel objects of creative value to humans relating to any one of the source domains. This allows some of the burden of creative content generation to be passed from humans to machines. The approach was tested primarily in the domain of chess problem composition. We used the DSNS technique to automatically compose numerous sets of chess problems based on attributes extracted and recombined from chess problems and tournament games by humans, renowned paintings, computer-evolved abstract art, photographs of people, and classical music tracks. The quality of these generated chess problems was then assessed automatically using an existing and experimentally-validated computational chess aesthetics model. They were also assessed by human experts in the domain. The results suggest that attributes collected and recombined from chess and other domains using the DSNS approach can indeed be used to automatically generate chess problems of reasonably high aesthetic quality. In particular, a low quality chess source (i.e. tournament game sequences between weak players) used in combination with actual photographs of people was able to produce three-move chess problems of comparable quality or better to those generated using a high quality chess source (i.e. published compositions by human experts), and more efficiently as well. Why information from a foreign domain can be integrated and functional in this way remains an open question for now. The DSNS approach is, in principle, scalable and applicable to any domain in which objects have attributes that can be represented using real numbers.",
         "Introduction": "Computational creativity can be classified as a relatively new sub-field of artificial intelligence (AI). In principle, it focuses on the generation of creative objects (e.g. music, visual art) using existing, modified and in some cases even new, typically domain-specific AI approaches or techniques. These objects are usually deemed to be creative from the perspective of humans sufficiently competent in the domain; otherwise known as 'experts' "

We have undertaken this task because this issue changes every day and it is a living and breathing part of the gaming industry in which each action has a reaction. Our findings show that there are a lot of different types of issues faced by these companies and there is very little a company can do to stop hacking and cheating to a full 100% effectiveness despite having many different anti-hacking/anti-cheating software to stop hackers and cheaters. There is very little a company can do to prevent hacking completely, as opposed to curing the problem as and when it occurs.",
         "Introduction": "Hacking and cheating are one of the issues in which contemporary gaming companies must deal with. Hacking is the ultimate issue, along with latency issues, that these companies must deal with because, especially for hacking, it is impossible to resolve ALL of the issues as these hacks are always being developed and changed and the only way in which these companies can stop them is by getting their hands on the hacks and developing their own anti-hack solution, such as a Punkbuster update or a VAC update to incorporate the anticheat code for the hack that is in question. Some cheats, such as exploiting, will never be solved as there is always going to be a loop hole of some kind, within the software's coding, that a user can exploit and gain an advantage over other players. Whether it be a duplicating exploit, or a simple geographic exploit, the user will always find a way around the intended coding and use this coding to their own advantage, in a way that is not intended by the software developer."

In this paper, we focus on efficiently searching for checkmates, putting to test various heuristics for guiding the search. We also present the findings of self-play experiments between different versions of the program.",

In addition, the sources inhibiting speedup were quantified.",
         "Introduction": "Computers play full-information strategy games with an algorithm called minimax search. In a minimax search tree, each node is a board state, its children are the results of all possible moves at that board state, and the root is the current board state. The goal is for the active player to pick a move that results in victory under the assumption that the opponent is also picking moves that result in his or her victory. Since tracing moves all the way to the end of the game is computationally intractable, a heuristic is used to estimate which leaves of the search tree are the most favorable board states. Ultimately, we output the best move, and if we used a heuristic, the score for that move."

The trained evaluation function performs comparably to the evaluation functions of state-of-the-art chess engines -all of which containing thousands of lines of carefully hand-crafted pattern recognizers, tuned over many years by both computer chess experts and human chess masters. Giraffe is the most successful attempt thus far at using end-to-end machine learning to play chess.",

Given any position, this system estimates the probability of each of the moves being the best move without looking ahead.

The method consists of providing the pattern along with a simplified view of it, the conversion queries to transform one into the other and the constraints to verify pattern conformance. The proposed process simplifies the tasks of the domain experts but preserves the integrity of the design patterns, favoring a well-designed and well documented data model which fosters data reuse. The work is illustrated with a linked dataset of chess games with the key information mapped to other linked datasets and supported by formalized design patterns. A chess dataset is presented as linked data.",
         "Introduction": "In the linked data publication paradigm, datasets typically consist of RDF statements connecting resources from different datasets. These statements may describe the resources using properties and classes further specified in ontologies, thus grounding the data model with a formal specification."

The technical requirement that White's moves should be essentially unique is a focus for the authors. Further motivation came from the recent definition of the 'Type B' depth-critical zugzwang. Following a survey of the latter in sub-6-man chess, the concept of the Cyclic Zugzwang CZ was defined, a zugzwang in which the defender can force the attacker through the shallow side of the zugzwang. Almost all CZs in sub-6-man chess have been enumerated. New studies on the theme of the CZ have been composed, some already published.",

It should have artistic content, for example a theme or a surprise, and give the pleasure of discovery and appreciation to its audience in the same way as a crossword or other puzzle does. It should also satisfy technical criteria. White should walk the thinnest possible line to its goal, its moves or equivalently the set of positions visited, being essentially if not absolutely unique given what is arguably the best opposition Black can muster.

Although many studies proved the link between mastery in chess and high degree of intelligence, just few studies proved that chess practice can enhance cognitive abilities. Starting from these considerations, the main purpose of the present research was to investigate the potential benefits of in-presence chess lessons and on-line training on mathematical problem-solving ability in young pupils (8 to 11 years old). Five hundred sixty students were divided into two groups, experimental (which had chess course and on-line training) and control (which had normal school activities), and tested on their mathematical and chess abilities. Results show a strong correlation between chess and math scores, and a higher improvement in math in the experimental group compared with the control group. These results foster the hypothesis that even a short-time practice of chess in children can be a useful tool to enhance their mathematical abilities.",

Methods: We used two nonlinear methods: Higuchi Fractal Dimension that is a good and fast tool for analyzing signal complexity and modification of Empirical Mode Decomposition, called Sliding Window Empirical Mode Decomposition, that breaks down a signal into its monocomponents. Obtained results are compared with the resting state i.e. EEG during relax witch closed eyes. Results: The analysis shows higher values of Higuchi Fractal Dimension during the thinking over chess moves than in the players' rest state. There are no statistically significant differences in contribution of EEG bands to total power of EEG calculated with Sliding Window Empirical Mode Decomposition.

It is an open question how to assess the difficulty automatically. In this paper, we present experiments with a computational approach to estimating the difficulty for humans of combinatorial problems such as chess. The approach is based on heuristic search by a computer to solve a given problem. Importantly, this search mimics human's problem solving taking into account the human's domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we investigate this approach in assessing the difficulty for humans of chess tactical problems. In the experiments, we used chess tactical problems supplemented with statistic-based difficulty ratings obtained from the Chess Tempo website. We assumed these ratings as true difficulties. A \"meaningful\" search tree was generated by computer game tree search which attempted to emulate human's problem solving. Automatic detectors of difficulty were then induced with machine learning techniques from properties of meaningful trees. In the experiments, a number of selected chess problems were classified into difficulty classes by human experts and by our automatic detector of difficulty. The accuracy of classifications by computer models compare favorably with the accuracy of human experts.",
         "Introduction": "The question of automatic determination of problem difficulty for humans is complex and concerns many aspects. It depends on the type of problem and on the human's knowledge about the problem domain. In this paper, we focus our investigation on tactical chess problems, in which the difficulty arises from the combinatorial complexity of problems. In solving such problems, humans have to use their knowledge of the domain, including pattern-based perceptual knowledge and the skill of position analysis through calculation of concrete variations of what can happen on the board "

         "Introduction": "In recent years, with the development of image processing technology and augmented reality technology matures, entertainment has changed a lot so designing a remote chess game based on augmented reality technology has the research significance of potential. Firstly, the camera shooting each other chess scene, compress the data of the other scene, transmit the data to the local computer Real time. Secondly, acquire the information of the pieces of positions and motions, and the images of hand motions in the local scene. Finally, the virtual chess pieces which designed according to the true pieces will be superimposed to remote image according to the position information, and at the same time the local hand motion will be synthesis to remote image. This eventually achieve two people can share a chessboard for chess as well they can see each other's manners, hear voices just as they were in the same scene, enhancing the feeling of immersion during recreation. There are lots of difficulties and key technology in the design and implementation of the system. In the system, how to detect the chess board efficiently and accurately and how to locate the chessboard coordinates in the regions scene are the important basis for the later work. There are many scholars at home and abroad in-depth study related to this technology. Among them, Dr. Zhang Zhiwei of University of Science & Technology China proposed a method of segmentation which according to the obvious difference of saturation between the chessboard and outsize board in the S component of HIS image. Dr Du Junli of the Huazhong University of Science and Technology put forward chess binary images method based on pixel difference threshold to detect the chessboard. Master Zhai Naiqiang puts forward a method of China chessboard recognition based on collaborative work of recognition of color and character. Through the study and research, found there are very strong restrictions on camera in checkerboard test stage. Generally the camera id restricted to place above the board area, and the acquisition obtained image is mainly the chess board regional image. The remote chess system base on augmented reality is to enable both sides to play chess is more able to feel the sense of immersion mainly, so the scene range should not only the chessboard area and the camera should not just above the chessboard. Combined with many research techniques, this article will introduce how to detect the checkerboard areas and how to carry out the chessboard coordinate in complex scenes."

State-of-the-art engines now provide an authoritative judgement that can be used in many applications like cheating detection, intrinsic ratings computation, skill assessment, or the study of human decision-making. A key issue for the research community is to gather a large dataset of chess games together with the judgement of chess engines. Unfortunately the analysis of each move takes lots of times. In this paper, we report our effort to analyse almost 5 millions chess games with a computing grid. During summer 2015, we processed 270 millions unique played positions using the Stockfish engine with a quite high depth (20). We populated a database of 1+ tera-octets of chess evaluations, representing an estimated time of 50 years of computation on a single machine. Our effort is a first step towards the replication of research results, the supply of open data and procedures for exploring new directions, and the investigation of software engineering/scalability issues when computing billions of moves.",

We contribute to this literature by studying gender differences in performance in a high-stakes and male dominated competitive environment, expert chess tournaments. Our findings show that women underperform compared to men of the same ability and that the gender composition of games drives this effect. Using within player variation in the conditionally random gender of their opponent, we find that women earn significantly worse outcomes against male opponents. We examine the mechanisms through which this effect operates by using a unique measure of within game quality of play. We find that the gender composition effect is driven by women playing worse against men, rather than by men playing better against women. The gender of the opponent does not affect a male player's quality of play. We also find that men persist longer against women before resigning. These results suggest that the gender composition of competitions affects the behavior of both men and women in ways that are detrimental to the performance of women. Lastly, we study the effect of competitive pressure and find that players' quality of play deteriorates when stakes increase, though we find no differential effect over the gender composition of games.",

Actual sex differences in chess performance were contrasted with differences estimated from the divergent participation rates of men and women chess players from twenty-four countries in the Eurasian region. There was a male advantage in chess performance throughout all countries. Sex differences in chess performance emerged for all the studied countries, with remarkable and highly variable unexplained gaps that were unrelated to the men versus women ratios. The cross-country variability about sex differences in chess performance indicates differences in geographical and cultural factors that might elicit differential participation rates, starting age, and perseverance in the domain for men and women.

In the present case, these analyses indicated that studies yielding a larger-than-average effect size were missing from the Gf model (1 study) and Gc model (3 studies). By contrast, the analyses suggested that studies yielding weaker-than-average effect sizes were missing from the Gsm, Gs, and full-scale IQ models (1 study, 2 studies, and 1 study, respectively).

         "Abstract": "Why are some people more skilled in complex domains than other people? Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between cognitive ability and skill in chess. Chess skill correlated positively and significantly with fluid reasoning (Gf) (r = 0.24), comprehension-knowledge (Gc) (r = 0.22), short-term memory (Gsm) (r = 0.25), and processing speed (Gs) (r = 0.24); the meta-analytic average of the correlations was (r = 0.24). Moreover, the correlation between Gf and chess skill was moderated by age (r = 0.32 for youth samples vs. r = 0.11 for adult samples), and skill level (r = 0.32 for unranked samples vs. r = 0.14 for ranked samples). Interestingly, chess skill correlated more strongly with numerical ability (r = 0.35) than with verbal ability (r = 0.19) or visuospatial ability (r = 0.13). The results suggest that cognitive ability contributes meaningfully to individual differences in chess skill, particularly in young chess players and/or at lower levels of skill.",

We apply this to Phantom Go, which, as all phantom games, is hard for opening book learning.

The paper suggests that pairwise comparison matrices perform well in similar ranking problems. Some features of the proposed method are illustrated by the results of the 18 th European Team Chess Championship. The analysis is able to take into account the influence of different opponents and robust with respect to the scaling technique chosen. The method is simple to compute as a solution of a linear equation system.",
         "Introduction": "In the world of sport various evaluation methods have been applied to determine the final ranking of players or teams based on matches between two participants. A kind of substitution for round-robin tournaments is the Swisssystem where all participants face each other for a determined number of games, without a knockout phase. It means that a loss in the first rounds does not make impossible for a contestant to triumph finally. Chess championships are often organised in this way due to the large number of players and tight time limits. It results in two interesting questions: how teams to be paired and how to determine the final ranking."

Without any a priori knowledge, in particular without any knowledge regarding the rules of chess, a deep neural network is trained using a combination of unsupervised pretraining and supervised training. The unsupervised training extracts high level features from a given position, and the supervised training learns to compare two chess positions and select the more favorable one. The training relies entirely on datasets of several million chess games, and no further domain specific knowledge is incorporated. The experiments show that the resulting neural network (referred to as DeepChess) is on a par with state-of-the-art chess playing programs, which have been developed through many years of manual feature selection and tuning. DeepChess is the first end-to-end machine learning-based method that results in a grandmaster-level chess playing performance.",

Though techniques for board recognition have been thoroughly explored in the past, especially in relation to chessboard calibration, previous works on piece recognition often focus on non-robust segmentation procedures that rely heavily on the exact color of customized chess boards and pieces. The method presented in this paper improves upon the segmentation-based approaches of previous work in piece recognition by introducing a novel approach using classifiers trained on feature descriptors, which is more robust to the similarities in color seen in real-life chess boards. This work is important for both automating the recording of moves in human chess games and improving the ability of chess-playing AI that depend on vision.",
         "Introduction": "The recording of moves during a chess game is often a tedious manual task that impedes the flow of the game, especially in formats such as speed chess where manually recording moves hinders efficient use of time. At the professional level, specialized chess sets have been developed to record moves automatically. However, this equipment is expensive and not easily accessible to recreational players. Further, in an age when much analysis and storage of chess games is done on computers, chess players at all levels can benefit from the ability to input games into a computerreadable format by simply taking a picture of a real-life board, as opposed to manual input. More recently, chessplaying AI have relied on either specialized equipment or human assistance in order to function. To truly create an autonomous chess-playing robot would require the ability to detect a chessboard and pieces through vision."

In this work we show experimentally that using larger images as opposed to smaller ones improves the output quality even further. The same is also true for using clearer or less corrupted images.

Combinatorial complexity generated by many sequential moves represents a difficult challenge for classic search algorithms. In this article, we present the design of a state-of-the-art program for Progressive chess. The program follows the generally recommended strategy for this game, which consists of three phases: looking for possibilities to checkmate the opponent, playing sequences of generally good moves when checkmate is not available, and preventing checkmates from the opponent. For efficient and effective checkmate search we considered two versions of the A* algorithm, and developed five different heuristics for guiding the search. For finding promising sequences of moves we developed another set of heuristics, and combined the A* algorithm with minimax search, in order to fight the combinatorial complexity. We constructed an opening book, and designed specialized heuristics for playing Progressive chess endgames. An application with a graphical user interface was implemented in order to enable human players to play Progressive chess against the computer, and to use the computer to analyze their games. The program performed excellently in experiments with checkmate search, and won both mini-matches against a human chess master. We also present the findings of self-play experiments between different versions of the program.",
         "Introduction": "Game playing has traditionally been described as an excellent test bed for designing and studying new algorithms. Some games are particularly challenging because the number of reachable, indistinguishable states far exceeds the storage and computational abilities of present-day computers, thus representing difficult problems even for state-of-the-art algorithms. In this paper, we focus on one such challenging game: a chess variant called Progressive chess. In this game, rather than just making one move per turn, players play progressively longer series of moves. White starts with one move, Black plays two consecutive moves, White then plays three moves, and so on."

The advantage of the Elo system is the explicit consideration of the factor time or the history of a journal's performance. Most other rankings that are commonly applied neglect this fact. The Elo ranking approach can easily be applied to any metric, published on a regular basis, to rank journals. We illustrate the approach using the SNIP indicator based on citation data from Scopus. Our balanced panel consists of 7,748 journals from many scientific fields for the period from 1999 to 2015. We show that the Elo approach produces a similar but not identical ranking compared to other rankings based on the SNIP. Especially the rank order for rather 'middle-class' journals can tremendously change.",
         "Introduction": "Measuring the 'quality' of scientific publishing has always been an important aspect for researchers, institutions, politics and the public. Next to financial incentives for the publisher, publications in high-quality journals are necessary prerequisites for future job market signals of the scientists. What defines a journal as 'high-quality' mainly depends on the classification or ranking scheme that is applied. The question on how such a classification scheme should look like has entailed a heated debate in general, which is especially pronounced in several scientific disciplines such as economics. In this article we do not want to comment the 'right' or the 'wrong' of existing rankings, but rather adopt a system that was originally developed for chess: the Elo rating system."

The electronic chess set is designed in order to attract the interest of the children on the chess game. Besides that, the game provides some basic rules for beginner. These rules are the placement of the chess pieces for the opening of the chess game and the rule of chess pieces' movement during the chess game. In order to increase the number of input or output pins of the Arduino microcontroller, the cascade encoder, multiplexer and shift register are designed. The placement and the type of the chess piece is detected using infrared light-emitting diode and photodiode with the aid of cascade encoder and multiplexer, whereas the valid destinations of the current chess piece are displayed using lightemitting diode with the aid of cascade shift register. The real situation of the chess game is also displayed on the computer screen using graphical user interface (GUI). The project achieved its objectives by demonstrating the capability to detect the position and type of chess piece, and displaying the real situation of the chess game on the computer screen via GUI.",

First, a common game model is proposed through various existing war chess types. Based on the model, we propose a theory frame involving combinational optimization on the one hand and game tree search on the other hand. We also discuss a key problem, namely, that the number of the branching factors of each turn in the game tree is huge. Then, we propose two algorithms for searching in one turn to solve the problem: (1) enumeration by order; (2) enumeration by recursion. The main difference between these two is the permutation method used: the former uses the dictionary sequence method, while the latter uses the recursive permutation method. Finally, we prove that both of these algorithms are optimal, and we analyze the difference between their efficiencies. An important factor is the total time taken for the unit to expand until it achieves its reachable position. The factor, which is the total number of expansions that each unit makes in its reachable position, is set. The conclusion proposed is in terms of this factor: Enumeration by recursion is better than enumeration by order in all situations.",

In transfer learning, training on a source task is leveraged to speed up or otherwise improve learning on a target task. This paper presents the more ambitious problem of curriculum learning in reinforcement learning, in which the goal is to design a sequence of source tasks for an agent to train on, such that final performance or learning speed is improved. We take the position that each stage of such a curriculum should be tailored to the current ability of the agent in order to promote learning new behaviors. Thus, as a first step towards creating a curriculum, the trainer must be able to create novel, agent-specific source tasks. We explore how such a space of useful tasks can be created using a parameterized model of the domain and observed trajectories on the target task. We experimentally show that these methods can be used to form components of a curriculum and that such a curriculum can be used successfully for transfer learning in 2 challenging multiagent reinforcement learning domains.",

It was the ultimate opportunity to practice writing concise and readable code, building thorough tests, receiving and giving code reviews, and communicating as part of a team. I am confident this experience has prepared me to be a high-impact contributor in an agile workflow."

The task was defined as a two-part classification problem: a piece-selector CNN is trained to score which white pieces should be made to move, and move-selector CNNs for each piece produce scores for where it should be moved. This approach reduced the intractable class space in chess by a square root.",

The piece-selector network was trained on all of these moves, and the move-selector networks trained on all moves made by the respective piece. Black moves were trained on by using a data augmentation to frame it as a move made by the white side."

         "Abstract": "Since the advent of computers, many tasks which required humans to spend a lot of time and energy have been trivialized by the computers' ability to perform repetitive tasks extremely quickly. However there are still many areas in which humans excel in comparison with the machines. One such area is chess. Even with great advances in the speed and computational power of modern machines, Grandmasters often beat the best chess programs in the world with relative ease 1 . This may be due to the fact that a game of chess cannot be won by pure calculation. There is more to the goodness of a chess position than some numerical value which apparently can be seen only by the human brain. Here an effort has been made to improve current chess engines by letting themselves evolve over a period of time. Firstly, the problem of learning is reduced into an optimization problem by defining Position Evaluation in terms of Positional Value Tables (PVTs). Next, the PVTs are optimized using Multi-Niche Crowding which successfully identifies the optima in a multimodal function, thereby arriving at distinctly different solutions which are close to the global optimum.",
         "Introduction": "The most important factor that influences the strength of a chess engine is the way in which it evaluates moves. Expert chess players master the game over years of learning and when they play the game their mental processes involve a complex synergy of computing possible board moves, memory from past games, heuristic thumb rules, watching for established patterns of play, etc. Invariably when humans play the game, the evaluation of a board position or a move is carried out over a complex hierarchy of abstractions which they are often unable to describe accurately. Trying to replicate or mimic these processes on a computer is futile given our current lack of understanding of these processes and abstractions that humans use. Most computer chess engines today resort to a range of heuristic tricks to somehow reduce the representation of a board position/move to a group of numbers. Every positional parameter which might influence its goodness must have a numerical equivalent in this group. The construction of such a group/vector of number is non-trivial. There are 2 main reasons for this:"

In this paper, we created a online chess game designed for people with dyslexia and seek to understand whether people with dyslexia learn and play chess online in ways that differ from other students and whether such differences may be leveraged to improve classroom performance. To test how people with dyslexia learn to play chess we carried out a within-subject experiment with 62 participants, 31 of them with diagnosed dyslexia. Participants used an instrumented web-based chess learning platform that we developed to (i) complete lessons on how to play chess and about chess theory, (ii) work through exercises designed to test and reaffirm their skills, and (iii) play chess against a computer opponent. We could not find significant differences on four dependent measures out of the twelve measures we collected. Therefore, dyslexia might have an impact on how people learn and play chess using a computer, suggesting that chess may be useful as a fun way to help people with dyslexia improve their abilities.",

Chess instruction has been proposed as one way to remedy this state of affairs, as well as improving other academic topics such as reading and general cognitive abilities such as intelligence. The aim of this paper is to quantitatively evaluate the available empirical evidence that skills acquired during chess instruction in schools positively transfer to mathematics, reading and general cognitive skills. The selection criteria were satisfied by 24 studies (40 effect sizes), with 2788 young people in the chess condition and 2433 in the control groups. The results show (a) a moderate overall effect size (g \u00bc 0.338); (b) a tendency for a stronger effect on mathematical (g \u00bc 0.382) than reading skill (g \u00bc 0.248), and (c) a significant and positive effect of duration of treatment (Q(1) \u00bc 3.89, b \u00bc 0.0038, p < .05). However, no study used an \"ideal design\" including preand post-test, full random allocation of participants to conditions and, most importantly, both a do-nothing control group and an active control group -a problem common in education research.

But the deficiencies of the Soviet economy might have resulted from other factors, such as Soviet history, culture, leadership, and/or unique circumstances, such as the Cold War. If so, the failure of the Soviet Union would not necessarily constitute evidence against the impossibility of central planning under different conditions. Yet, in some areas such as chess and the Olympics, central planning in the Soviet Union was remarkably successful. We examine the implications of Soviet successes in Olympics and chess to reassess the epistemic and motivational arguments against central planning. We contend that three factors help explain Soviet sports successes: first, the objectivity of success in sports or chess in contrast with the subjectivity of economic success; second, the importance of fame and renown as motives for Olympic class athletes and chess grand masters; and third, the poor economic performance of the Soviet Union, which helped ensure incentive compatibility. The Soviet Union's success in achieving goals that did not require complex economic information or a fundamental realignment of incentives, but not in centrally planning the economy, reinforce the epistemic and motivational arguments against economic central planning.",

This new model considers the move prediction problem as group competitions while also taking the interaction between features into account. A FBT model is able to provide a probability distribution that expresses a preference over moves. Therefore it can be easily compiled into an evaluation function and applied in a modern Go program. We propose a Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) algorithm to train a FBT model using expert game records, and provide two methods for fast computation of the gradient in order to speed up the training process. Experimental results show that our FBT model outperforms the state-of-the-art move prediction system of Latent Factor Ranking (LFR).",

Several works support the SLODR, albeit other studies have questioned it with one of the main criticisms being the splitting up between low and high ability groups. This study evaluates the SLODR with data from the chess domain with the Amsterdam chess test (ACT). Chess ability relates closely with several cognitive abilities that load in g, whereas the Elo chess rating is a robust quantitative indicator of chess skill that is suitable to determine differentiated ability groups. A structural equation model with five subtests from the ACT for low and high Elo chess rating groups indicated a better overall model fit for the low ability group. Factor invariance analyses about the variance explained by g, residual variances, and g-loadings, indicated that the highest variation between low and high chess ability groups arose in the model constraining equal g-loadings between both groups. These findings supported the SLODR in chess.",

Next, we recast a number of ranking theories within Landau's framework, thereby showing similarities and the ease with which each may be deduced from the previous one. The fields covered are sports, social choice, sociology, bibliometrics, internet ranking, learning, network economics and management. We show the closeness of the Landau with the Leontief input-output model and how the former is the limit of the latter. Lastly, we give self-contained proofs of the Perron and Frobenius theorems whose use in the social sciences Landau pioneered.",
         "Introduction": "Many fields of science face the task of ranking items characterized by multiple attributes that are not immediately comparable. In psychology, linguistics or marketing, paired comparisons allow to overcome this difficulty simply by asking subjects to scale extremely diverse subjective attributes such as consumer goods, moral values, physical stimuli, art works, other people or university exams. The great advantage of this binary process is to eliminate the subjective bias of the comparator, whether she is a patient, a consumer, a voter, a judge or an expert. Indeed, even if her personal experience leads her to adopt a subjective scale significantly different from an established standard, her answer will solely reveal which of the two items she prefers or sees better with respect to a pre established criteria."

         "Abstract": "In the current era of big data, high volumes of a wide variety of data of different veracity can be easily collected or generated at a high velocity. Embedded in these big data is valuable information or knowledge. This calls for machine learning techniques for supporting advanced knowledge discovery from these big heterogeneous data. A rich source of big data is game data, which include data collected from sports games, card games, online video games, and board games like chess games. The deep interaction and simplicity of representation afforded by the game of chess have worked together to produce one of the most studied games in the world. It is a great intellectual challenge, and not only for humans. While chess engines can sometimes play chess better than grandmasters and can be used to assist the study of games or individual positions, the engines may not help a chess student choose which games to study. In this paper, we present a machine learning system with unsupervised learning and supervised learning components to analyze big chess data. Evaluation results show that not only can machine learning help find interesting games, but also that chess can be a great testing ground for machine learning and data mining techniques for big data analytics.",

A good evaluation function is carefully designed to calculate the position value and material value. However, it requires a large amount of expert knowledge to construct good evaluation function. Endgame databases of Chinese dark chess provide theoretical values for all legal positions of a given piece combination. By using the information from endgame database, the constructed approximated evaluation function can be use to valid and fine-tune the original evaluation function of any program. Experiment result shows that the approximation evaluation function is both highly correlated to the original evaluation and the theoretical value in the endgame database, therefore it can be used to adjust the original evaluation function with the data extracted from endgame database.",

For instance the strategies for the strongest poker agents are represented as massive binary files. In many situations, we would like to compute strategies that can actually be implemented by humans, who may have computational limitations and may only be able to remember a small number of features or components of the strategies that have been computed. For example, a human poker player or military leader may not have access to large precomputed tables when making real-time strategic decisions. We study poker games where private information distributions can be arbitrary (i.e., players are dealt cards from different distributions, which depicts the phenomenon in large real poker games where at some points in the hand players have different distribution of hand strength by applying Bayes' rule given the history of play in the hand thus far). We create a large training set of game instances and solutions, by randomly selecting the information probabilities, and present algorithms that learn from the training instances to perform well in games with unseen distributions. We are able to conclude several new fundamental rules about poker strategy that can be easily implemented by humans.",

         ],
         "Abstract": "Readers of Baudrillard know that he thought about competition in sport and games in terms of failure and frailty. In For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign, exchange value and symbolic ambivalence are mutually exclusive domains; in the latter, desire is not satisfied through phantasmic completion, and this entails that desire may ride failure to an ignominious counter-victory. Baudrillard found in the failure to react positively to an inducement like winning a race -captured in that bizarre American football phrase appropriated as a handle by Ronald Reagan, \u00abWin One for the Gipper!\u00bb -the principle of a radical counter-economy of needs. Losers come in all shades. But radical losers stand apart from the crowd in the virulence of their capacity to radiate loss that they throw down as a challenge. There are those who are irresistibly drawn to blowing it, and others who can taste failure and steal it from the jaws of victory. From the Beatles to Beck, the figure of the loser has fascinated lyricists and theorists alike as not merely sympathetic but as a foundation for a deliberate weakness in the face of overwhelming odds and the false pretenses of victory. Here I revisit Jean Baudrillard's speculations about computer chess programs, specifically IBM's Deep and Deeper Blue, and how best to play against them. Drawing on Baudrillard's theory of loss in sports as an act of contempt for the fruits of victory, institutional accommodation, and the cheap inducements of prestige and glory, I examine how chess masters like Garry Kasparov have met the challenge of the brute force programs -some of which were congealed models of his own play -with appeals to a kind of unforced play and even 'non-thought'. Considering the malevolent and fictional computer system HAL, as well as Deep Blue and subsequent programs, right up to IBM's Jeopardy-playing computer 'Watson', this paper looks at ways to defeat programming power by critically regaining the counter-technical and (dys)functional skills of the loser. *** \u00abThe film The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner is a very fine example, from a social and political point of view, of this ubiquitous counter-economy. The hero is an adolescent in a rehabilitation center who deliberately renounces a decisive victory in a running contest in order to avoid spreading any of the glory to his institutional oppressors. By losing, he preserves his own truth: here, failure merges with class revolt. Admittedly, in this story, the failure is explicitly deliberate, but it is not difficult to see how 'accidental' lapses and physical slips may acquire virtually the same meaning of denial and resistance\u00bb Jean Baudrillard, For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign",
         "Introduction": "The transition from the symbolic necessity of either throwing or blowing it to the charm of weak play is evident in Baudrillard's discussion of IBM's chess computer Deep Blue and its first six-game match against world champion Garry Kasparov in 1996. I want to extend the lessons of Baudrillard's scattered, but overall coherent, remarks on competition to the context of chess played between a world champion and a specialized machine. I do this against the background of earlier celluloid dreams about artificial intelligence manifested in the malevolent supercomputer HAL in Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)."

Action games represent the type of experimental paradigm that Newell was advocating and the current state of programming expertise and laboratory equipment, along with the emergence of Big Data and naturally occurring datasets, provide the technologies and data needed to realize his vision. Action games enable us to escape from our field's regrettable focus on novice performance to develop theories that account for the full range of expertise through a twin focus on expertise sampling (across individuals) and longitudinal studies (within individuals) of simple and complex tasks.",

He used the example of the game of chess -where one would think complexity mattered positively -to illustrate this point. In this article, we explain how the same idea was tested but using a modern computational chess aesthetics model. We found, once again, and to a statistically significant degree, that the complexity of a chess puzzle or problem does not, on average, improve its aesthetic appeal. This suggests that making things more complicated than need be, simply to make the solution more difficult to find, especially in chess, should be avoided if improving aesthetics is the goal. This finding may be relevant to other artistic endeavours beyond chess as well.",

Very first results from initial evaluation studies indicate that the presented solution allows for a reliable automatic offline analysis of the underlying strategic and attentional processes of chess behaviour in real game situations without any need for an error prone and time consuming manual data annotation. The proposed solution allows to run chess studies in shorter time and to analyse the differences between chess experts and novices with respect to visual attention and strategies in more detail. Finally, gained insights can be used to develop interactive and intuitive electronic chess assistant systems to analyse the weaknesses of both experts and novices and to recommend optimal moves in given chess situations, as well as to enhance players' expertise with individualized training methods and explanations.",

Moreover, it is characterized by exactly differentiable skill levels and, although embedded into an easily controllable setting, limited in space, material and time, it is extremely complex in event space constellations. Therefore, chess involves great complexity in decision making, strategy and memory.

Generalizing a known result on so-called Richman games, we show that for a natural class of games including bidding chess, each position can be assigned rational upper and lower values corresponding to the limit proportion of money that Black (say) needs in order to force a win and to avoid losing, respectively.",
         "Introduction": "In chess, positions with only three pieces (the two kings and one more piece) are perfectly understood. The only such endgame requiring some finesse is king and pawn versus king, but even that endgame is played flawlessly by amateur players. In this article we investigate a chess variant where already positions with three pieces exhibit a complexity far beyond what can be embraced by a human."

It seems useful to catalog similar positions in a generic, pattern form, in order to simplify the search of chess positions based on common elements. A simple chess pattern language is used here to develop a chess program that is patterns-oriented. The aim is to avoid a commonly-used brute force approach. Further, the language could show the reason why some typical maneuvers actually work in some patterns. This also can be a step forward to try to model and build chess programs, which can play more closely to the way a human being does.",

Curiously, these elements often occur in positions that appear to be different. Nevertheless, a closer analysis shows that there are common elements that repeat. And just as these configurations are repeated, the way of dealing with them is also repeated, which is interpreted as \"making the right moves\"."

         "Introduction": "Artificial intelligence has seen a number of breakthroughs in recent years, with games often serving as significant milestones. A common feature of games with these successes is that they involve information symmetry among the players, where all players have identical information. This property of perfect information, though, is far more common in games than in real-world problems. Poker is the quintessential game of imperfect information, and it has been a longstanding challenge problem in artificial intelligence. In this paper we introduce DeepStack, a new algorithm for imperfect information settings such as poker. It combines recursive reasoning to handle information asymmetry, decomposition to focus computation on the relevant decision, and a form of intuition about arbitrary poker situations that is automatically learned from selfplay games using deep learning. In a study involving dozens of participants and 44,000 hands of poker, DeepStack becomes the first computer program to beat professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em. Furthermore, we show this approach dramatically reduces worst-case exploitability compared to the abstraction paradigm that has been favored for over a decade."

Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used on 12 healthy male novice chess players to identify cortical regions associated with chess, ToM and empathizing. The blood-oxygenationlevel-dependent (BOLD) response for chess and empathizing tasks was extracted from each ToM region. Results showed neural overlap between ToM, chess and empathizing tasks in right-hemisphere temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) [BA40], left-hemisphere superior temporal gyrus [BA22] and posterior cingulate gyrus [BA23/31]. TPJ is suggested to underlie the capacity to reason iteratively about another's internal state in a range of tasks. Areas activated by ToM and empathy included right-hemisphere orbitofrontal cortex and bilateral middle temporal gyrus: areas that become active when there is need to inhibit one's own experience when considering the internal state of another and for visual evaluation of action rationality. Results support previous findings, that ToM recruits a neural network with each region sub-serving a supporting role depending on the nature of the task itself. In contrast, a network of cortical regions primarily located within right-and left-hemisphere medial-frontal and parietal cortex, outside the internal representational network, was selectively recruited during the chess task. We hypothesize that in our cohort of novice chess players the strategy was to employ an iterative thinking pattern which in part involved mentalizing processes and recruited core ToM-related regions.",

Games can be played between chess engines alone or between clusters created by combined chess engines. The system has a built-in mechanism that compares engines, based on Elo ranking which finally presents the strength of each tested approach. If an approach needs more computational power, the design of the system allows it to scale. The system was designed using a loosely coupled architecture approach and the master-slave pattern. It works under Unix or MacOS operating systems. In order to split chess engine processing between every CPU in the system the Akka technology with the Scala language was used while the other part was written in Java. We tested many free chess engines connected to the system by the UCI protocol supported by the proposed system. CloudAMQP is an implementation of Advanced Message Queue Protocol and was used as a message-oriented middleware. This layer was created to split games between every available processing node connected to the system. This element also contributes to greater fault tolerance. We present results of games played between many available chess engines.",

This evidence suggests that intelligence plays an important role in the acquisition of expertise. However, a counter argument is that the difference between experts and non-experts is not due to individuals' traits but to academic selection processes. For instance, in science, high scores on standardized tests (e.g., SAT and then GRE) are needed to be admitted to a university program for training. Thus, the \"academic selection process\" hypothesis is that expert vs. non-expert differences in cognitive ability reflect ability-related differences in access to training opportunities. To test this hypothesis, we focused on a domain in which there are no selection processes based on test scores: chess. This meta-analysis revealed that chess players outperformed non-chess players in intelligence-related skills (d = 0.49). Therefore, this outcome does not corroborate the academic selection process argument, and consequently, supports the idea that access to training alone cannot explain expert performance.",

         "Abstract": "Playing a combinatorial game might sometimes be extremely difficult for the human mind. For centuries, humans have always attempted to develop algorithms in order to discover a way to always win every match of a particular game, which is not only efficient in time, but also has almost 100% chance of winning. One of the examples of this combinatorial game is \"Go\", a Chinese board game similar to chess, but much more complex and mindblowing. This paper discusses how the Monte Carlo tree search is used in the computer program AlphaGo in order to win almost every match of a Go game.",
         "Introduction": "Go (\u570d\u68cb w\u00e9iq\u00ed) is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. The game was invented in ancient China more than 5,500 years ago, and is thus the oldest board game continuously played today. The earliest written reference to the game is generally recognized as the historical Zuo Zhuan."

         "Introduction": "Games are an ideal model system to research and develop artificial intelligence (AI). In chess, information is perfect and symmetric, and decision-making is logical and ranges from boolean to fuzzy logic, and is alternately challenged by sequential complex puzzles and nontrivial positions throughout the iterative game. This provides an ideal IT assay model system to develop and test AI and machine learning in the field of decision-making and machine learning via continuous improvement. It represents an ideal and major challenge for the development of AI software and general reinforcement self-learning programs due to the simultaneously high levels of game complexity and the vast amount of branching positions and a lower bound of about 10 120 possible games according to the Shannon number. Hence, engines and players must somehow find the best ways and algorithms to manage certainty and uncertainty in their evaluations. A recent report by Silver and colleagues 1 has claimed a big major breakthrough that has been widely perceived as such by most of the noticed experts in the field and by the media. Many speak of a major milestone that has been reached by developing a pure machine self-learning algorithm that can outperform even the best conventional chess engine, which is an equally significant and relevant benchmark. According to the authors, this world-breakthrough has been achieved by simply advancing and adopting the Alpha Go program to Chess, next to Shogi, a Japanese Chess form, and Go, games where it also won outstandingly.

Methods/Statistical Analysis: For dealing with probabilistic Krieg spiel, we took as a basis the proposal of Ciancarini, DallaLibera & Maran. They consider four Krieg spiel patterns which we modified to fulfill the probabilistic requirements of the tackled endgames. A strategy was also proposed for when none of these patterns is fulfilled. We developed an automaton which implements the proposed probabilistic patterns. Findings: Our results showed the feasibility of our proposal, where White won or drew as expected. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal that considers probabilistic Krieg spiel. Our automaton shows that when working with probabilities in Krieg spiel, it is not always convenient to play considering the higher probability. Our proposal develops a strategy that can help competitors to make better decisions when they have incomplete information about a specific situation, e.g., to choose between two alternatives, each with its respective probability. Application/Improvements: We believe that our proposal may be useful in areas where uncertainty occurs. It can help analysts, particularly in the economics and artificial intelligence, to make decisions when uncertainty occurs.",
         "Introduction": "Kriegspiel (from the German Kriegspiel, with double's': war game) is a variant of chess that is played between two players assisted by a referee. Each player has his own chessboard and knows the position of his pieces, but not those of his opponent. The referee knows the position of the pieces of the two players. When a player has to move, he informs the referee of his move and the referee will inform him whether it is legal or illegal. If it is legal and a piece is captured or a check occurs, both players are informed; if a piece is captured it is informed that a capture was made, but it is not indicated which piece was captured. If it is illegal (e.g., a player tries to advance a pawn and a piece blockades it, a player tries to move the king to a square where it would be in check) the player must choose another move."

However, the process towards expertise has been generally unexplored concerning top experts at the extreme upper tail of the chess skill distribution. This study analyzed the top hundred chess players in the world from 2009 to 2015. A cross-domain latent curve model (LCM) was used to examine individual differences in age and in the simultaneous trajectory in chess tournament activity and chess performance. The main findings indicated individual differences in the change in tournament activity and performance, albeit tournament activity decreased whereas performance increased. Younger players were more involved in tournament activity and increased their performance at a faster pace than older players did. The dynamic change in tournament activity was a stronger predictor of the change in performance than the static cumulated amount of activity. Age and the change in tournament activity explained only half of the variation in the change in performance across the observed period.",

This was achieved just by self-play, without access to any knowledge of these games other than the rules of the game. In this paper we consider some limitations to this spectacular success. The program was trained in well-defined and relatively small domains (admittedly with enormous combinatorial complexity) compared to many real world problems, and it was possible to generate large amounts of learning data through simulated games which is typically not possible in real life domains. When it comes to understanding the games played by AlphaZero, the program's inability to explain its games and the knowledge acquired in humanunderstandable terms is a serious limitation.",

This project is a base that will enable future employment of Baxter for more intricate and advanced research topics. This project was derived to showcase a large portion of Baxter's functionality in an easily digestible and potentially expandable format. It will display a convenient form of user interaction (voice commands), utilization of computer vision (detecting chess board and pieces), and safe and precise physical interactions with or near humans (moving chess pieces). The goal of this project is to enable the Baxter robotic system to move chess pieces on a chess board based on user input in the form of voice commands. This can be broken up into four main parts: physical movement of Baxter's appendages, computer vision to locate the board and chess pieces, voice recognition and speech output for the necessary set of commands, and internal chess board state information and chess logic.",

The book under construction is represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph, with chess positions as nodes and moves as directed arcs between nodes. Each position is given an absolute position probability that a game played between the given and being-constructed book will eventually reach that position. Books for White and Black are constructed separately. Assuming a book is being constructed for White, a position priority queue repeatedly chooses the highest-probability unexpanded position for expansion. If it is Black's turn to move, moves with move probabilities for the position are copied from the given book. If it is White's turn to move, a search determines the best move, which is added with move probability one. More-probable positions are searched to a greater depth. Several books for White, representing a range of build CPU time, were constructed to be used in play against the book that comes with Crafty version 25.0.1, CB25.0.1. The strongest, B29, took 12 CPU-days to build. In 1000-game matches against Black/CB25.0.1 (Black using CB25.0.1 book), White/B29 scored 64 ELO points higher than did White/CB25.0.1.",

A first \"ludometric\" concern is the empirical measurement of the amount of luck in various games. We argue against a narrow view of luck which includes only factors outside any player's control, and advocate for a holistic definition of luck as complementary to the variation in effective skill within a population of players. We introduce two metrics for luck in a game for a given population -one information theoretical, and one Bayesian, and discuss the estimation of these metrics using sparse, high-dimensional regression techniques. Finally, we apply these techniques to compare the amount of luck between various professional sports, between Chess and Go, and between two hobby board games: Race for the Galaxy and Seasons.",

'Emphasizing' conventions here means the addition of a small modification to the automatic composing process in that the position in memory which satisfies the most number of selected conventions is favored during composition and becomes the new starting point for further composition. This is opposed to the default process of constantly rejecting positions that do not meet all the specified conventions at once. The experimental results indicate that the new modification increased composing efficiency but expectedly, not aesthetic quality. Given the improved efficiency, we could now also further investigate the importance of applying more convention filters in composing. The experimental results there showed that using more conventions does indeed improve the aesthetics of the compositions but suggests using just one more convention in addition to the existing ones may not be significant. Rather, two or more in addition are probably required. These findings can help improve the output and quality of automatic chess problem composers, regardless of their particular additional or background composing techniques.",

         "Abstract": "The expertise effect in memory for chess positions is one of the most robust effects in cognitive psychology. One explanation of this effect is that chess recall is based on the recognition of familiar patterns and that experts have learned more and larger patterns. Template theory and its instantiation as a computational model are based on this explanation. An alternative explanation is that the expertise effect is due, in part, to stronger players having better and more conceptual knowledge, with this knowledge facilitating memory performance. Our literature review supports the latter view. In our experiment, a sample of 79 chess players were given a test of memory for chess positions, a test of declarative chess knowledge, a test of fluid intelligence, and a questionnaire concerning the amount of time they had played nontournament chess and the amount of time they had studied chess. We determined the numbers of tournament games the players had played from chess databases. Chess knowledge correlated .67 with chess memory and accounted for 16% of the variance after controlling for chess experience. Fluid intelligence accounted for an additional 13% of the variance. These results support the conclusion that both high-level conceptual processing and low-level recognition of familiar patterns play important roles in memory for chess positions.",

The system is based on an industrial-grade robot manipulator, a computer vision system, and an open source chess engine. Classification algorithms were implemented in order to detect whether a given chessboard square is occupied, and in that case, if the piece is black or white. Such algorithms were compared in terms of their complexity of implementation, execution time and accuracy of predictions. To achieve an uniform illumination of the chessboard, a theoretical model of an LED illuminance curve was used to find the best orientation for each diode using a genetic algorithm. Both the support base for the LEDs and the chess pieces were made using a 3D printer. This implementation demonstrates the capabilities of the proposed vision-based system, whose complexity can be increased in the future for a number of applications.",
         "Introduction": "In general, chess games require the location and identification of a set of pieces on a board, knowledge of the game rules -the set of posible valid moves to execute-, a representation of the actual state of the game for future decision making, and the manipulation of physical parts; all this while coordinating with the human opponent. This work presents a mechatronic system consisting of a robotic arm that plays chess in an autonomous manner against a human opponent."

Curiously, these elements often occur in positions that appear to be different. Nevertheless, a closer analysis shows that there are common elements that repeat. And just as these configurations are repeated, the way of dealing with them is also repeated, which is interpreted as \"making the right moves\"."

         "Abstract": "This paper provides a complexity analysis for the game of reconnaissance blind chess (RBC), a recently-introduced variant of chess where each player does not know the positions of the opponent's pieces a priori but may reveal a subset of them through chosen, private sensing actions. In contrast to commonly studied imperfect information games like poker and Kriegspiel, an RBC player does not know what the opponent knows or has chosen to learn, exponentially expanding the size of the game's information sets (i.e., the number of possible game states that are consistent with what a player has observed). Effective RBC sensing and moving strategies must account for the uncertainty of both players, an essential element of many real-world decision-making problems. Here we evaluate RBC from a game theoretic perspective, tracking the proliferation of information sets from the perspective of selected canonical bot players in tournament play. We show that, even for effective sensing strategies, the game sizes of RBC compare to those of Go while the average size of a player's information set throughout an RBC game is much greater than that of a player in Heads-up Limit Hold 'Em. We compare these measures of complexity among different playing algorithms and provide cursory assessments of the various sensing and moving strategies.",

The method that we present aims to train different ANN architectures to understand chess positions similarly to how highly rated human players do. We investigate the capabilities that ANNs have when it comes to pattern recognition, an ability that distinguishes chess grandmasters from more amateur players. We collect around 3,000,000 different chess positions played by highly skilled chess players and label them with the evaluation function of Stockfish, one of the strongest existing chess engines. We create 4 different datasets from scratch that are used for different classification and regression experiments. The results show how relatively simple Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) outperform Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in all the experiments that we have performed. We also investigate two different board representations, the first one representing if a piece is present on the board or not, and the second one in which we assign a numerical value to the piece according to its strength. Our results show how the latter input representation influences the performances of the ANNs negatively in almost all experiments.",
         "Introduction": "Despite what most people think, highly rated chess players do not differ from the lower rated ones in their ability to calculate a lot of moves ahead. On the contrary, what makes chess grandmasters so strong is their ability to understand which kind of board situation they are facing very quickly. According to these evaluations, they decide which chess lines to calculate and how many positions ahead they need to check, before committing to an actual move."

I used data from over 5.5 million games of international tournament chess and found no evidence of a stereotype-threat effect. In fact, female players outperform expectations when playing men. Further analysis showed no influence of degree of challenge, player age, nor prevalence of female role models in national chess leagues on differences in performance when women play men versus when they play women. Though this analysis contradicts one specific mechanism of influence of gender stereotypes, the persistent differences between male and female players suggest that systematic factors do exist and remain to be uncovered.",

However, parts of the algorithm were specific to poker, which enjoys many properties not shared by other imperfect information games. We present a domain-independent formulation of CR applicable to any twoplayer zero-sum extensive-form games that works with an abstract resolving algorithm. We further describe and implement its Monte Carlo variant (MCCR) which uses Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) as a resolver. We prove the correctness of CR and show an O(T -1/2 )-dependence of MCCR's exploitability on the computation time. Furthermore, we present an empirical comparison of MCCR with incremental tree building to Online Outcome Sampling and Information-set MCTS on several domains.",

On the other hand, online algorithms can produce strong strategies with a fraction of memory and computation time required by the offline approaches.

Also, in draughts it is mandatory to capture the largest number of pieces possible, while in checkers this is not the case (although capturing is still mandatory)."

Their relative position is likely to be lower in the former than in the latter, presenting them with a dilemma. This study is one of the first to empirically examine such choices and their implications in the context of sporting competitions, specifically chess tournaments in Israel. In chess tournaments, players of medium ranking are often given a choice: to compete against stronger opponents in the main tournament (and likely be at \"the back of a pride of lions\") or to compete against weaker opponents in the secondary tournament (and likely be at \"the head of a pack of foxes\"). Using official chess results provided by the Israeli Chess Federation, we identified the players who were in a position to choose between participating in a main and a secondary tournament from 2010 through 2017.",
         "Introduction": "Individuals often have to choose between alternative competitive arenas in which success depends on relative performance. When different competitions have different skill requirements, choosing to participate in a more prestigious competition instead of a less prestigious one usually means accepting a relatively lower rank. Dilemmas of this sort abound: choosing to study at an institution of high education, choosing which market to enter, what vocational training to pursue, or which firm to join. This trade-off between being at \"the head of a pack of foxes\" or \"the back of a pride of lions\" (translated from the Mishna, Pirkei Avot, 20, 4) also characterizes many decisions in sports, yet very little literature has focused on it directly."

Although starting from zero knowledge has been shown to yield impressive results, it is associated with high computationally costs especially for complex games. With this paper, we present CrazyAra which is a neural network based engine solely trained in supervised manner for the chess variant crazyhouse. Crazyhouse is a game with a higher branching factor than chess and there is only limited data of lower quality available compared to AlphaGo. Therefore, we focus on improving efficiency in multiple aspects while relying on low computational resources. These improvements include modifications in the neural network design and training configuration, the introduction of a data normalization step and a more sample efficient Monte-Carlo tree search which has a lower chance to blunder. After training on 569,537 human games for 1.5 days we achieve a move prediction accuracy of 60.4 %. During development, versions of CrazyAra played professional human players. Most notably, CrazyAra achieved a four to one win over 2017 crazyhouse world champion Justin Tan (aka LM Jann Lee) who is more than 400 Elo higher rated compared to the average player in our training set. Furthermore, we test the playing strength of CrazyAra on CPU against all participants of the second Crazyhouse Computer Championships 2017, winning against twelve of the thirteen participants. Finally, for CrazyAraFish we continue training our model on generated engine games. In ten long-time control matches playing Stockfish 10, CrazyAraFish wins three games and draws one out of ten matches.",

Automatically classifying a chess problem as being easy, moderate or difficult therefore helps in that regard. In this article, we explain a formula for this that relies on five variables, i.e. chess engine solving time, total piece count, total piece value, move length and an adjusted number to represent the variations possible. The method was tested on samples of forced mates (3, 4 and 5movers) including both published chess problems by human composers and computer-generated ones. Statistical analyses of the results were significant and as expected based on the groups tested. Such problems may therefore then be classified as 'easy', 'moderate' or 'difficult' based on percentile. The lowest third of scores is considered easy, for example. Longer sequences that do not end in checkmate (such as studies) is still an open problem in terms of solvability using this approach mainly because even good chess engines often cannot solve them conclusively enough to establish the time variable and the number of variations possible.",

We analyze the impact of team play strategies in skill acquisition using a turn-based game where players can participate individually or in teams. We unveil a subtle but strong effect in skill acquisition based on the way teams are formed and maintained during time. \"Faithfulness-boost effect\" provides a skill boost during the first games that would only be acquired after thousands of games. The tendency to play games in teams is associated with a long-run skill improvement while playing loyally with the same teammate significantly accelerates shortrun skill acquisition.",

However, little is known about dementia protective factors and their potential benefits against disease decline in the diagnosed population. Cognitive stimulating activities seem to be protective factors against dementia, though there is paucity in the scientific evidence confirming this, with most publications focusing on prevention in non-diagnosed people. A scoping review was conducted to explore whether chess practice could mitigate signs, deliver benefits, or improve cognitive capacities of individuals diagnosed with dementia through the available literature, and therefore act as a protective factor. Methods: twenty-one articles were selected after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: the overall findings stress that chess could lead to prevention in non-diagnosed populations, while little has been shown with respect to individuals already diagnosed. However, some authors suggest its capacity as a protective factor due to its benefits, and the evidence related to the cognitive functions associated with the game. Conclusion: although chess is indirectly assumed to be a protective factor due to its cognitive benefits, more studies are required to demonstrate, with strong evidence, whether chess could be a protective factor against dementia within the diagnosed population.",

In contrast to many commonly studied imperfect information games like poker, an RBC player does not know what the opponent knows or has chosen to learn, exponentially expanding the size of the game's information sets (i.e., the number of possible game states that are consistent with what a player has observed). Effective RBC sensing and moving strategies must account for the uncertainty of both players, an essential element of many real-world decision-making problems. Here we evaluate RBC from a game theoretic perspective, tracking the proliferation of information sets from the perspective of selected canonical bot players in tournament play. We show that, even for effective sensing strategies, the game sizes of RBC compare to those of Go while the average size of a player's information set throughout an RBC game is much greater than that of a player in Heads-up Limit Hold 'Em. We compare these measures of complexity among different playing algorithms and provide cursory assessments of the various sensing and moving strategies.",

         "Abstract": "Giulio Campi's painting The Game of Chess (c. 1530-32) presents us with an interesting rendition of a popular pastime in sixteenth-century Italy. At a table holding the chessboard, a knight and a well-dressed woman are engaged in chess combat, while gathered around them are several onlookers and a scowling dwarf jester who commands the woman's attention. This essay examines the sources for Campi's unusual iconography, showing how he based his imagery on artistic and literary conventions fashioning chess as an allegory of love. While erotic fulfillment is thus the subtext of the game in progress, Campi's composition also betrays his knowledge of new rules of chess play. The queen was assigned increased powers, which led to the revised game being referred to as scacchi alla rabiosa, or \"mad chess.\" Campi alludes to this transformed game through the gestures and attributes of the female player-and her linkage with the \"mad\" dwarf jester.",

Chess agents designed for human-agent play are capable of adjusting their level, however their style is not aligned with that of human players. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for designing such agents by integrating the theory of chess players' decision-making with a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach using two sets of analyses. Quantitatively, we establish that the agents attain their desired Elo ratings. Qualitatively, through a Turing-inspired test with a human chess expert, we show that our agents are indistinguishable from human players.",

However, the effects of long-term practice on functional network hubs in chess experts are largely undefined. Here, we investigated whether alterations of hubs can be detected in chess experts using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and graph theory methods. We first mapped the whole-brain voxel-wise functional connectivity and calculated the functional connectivity strength (FCS) map in each of the 28 chess players and 27 gender-and age-matched healthy novice players. Whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity analyses for the changed hub areas were conducted to further elucidate the corresponding changes of functional connectivity patterns in chess players. The hub analysis revealed increased FCS in the right posterior fusiform gyrus of the chess players, which was supported by analyses of this area's regional homogeneity (ReHo), amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), and fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF). The following functional connectivity analyses revealed increased functional connectivities between the right posterior fusiform gyrus and the visuospatial attention and motor networks in chess players. These findings demonstrate that cognitive expertise has a positive influence on the functions of the brain regions associated with the chess expertise and that increased functional connections might in turn facilitate within and between networks communication for expert behavior to get superior performance.",

The aim of the present study was to describe and compare the brain electrical activity pattern of chess players in two different situations under time pressure to make the move: rapid, 15 min, plus 10 s additional time per move and lightning, a one-minute game. Thus, lightning game offers an appropriate environment to isolate memory chunks and rapid game will offer the perspective of a working memory task. Encephalogram (EEG) recordings were obtained while a total of 14 male chess players (age: 35.36 \u00b1 13.77 and ELO: 1921.07 \u00b1 170.67) played lightning and rapid chess games. Results indicate that different activity patterns between the rapid and the lightning games were found. Increments in theta power during lightning game in posterior regions could indicate that theta power might be related with chunks retrieval. Moreover, right hemisphere is more activated in chess games, probably caused by visuospatial processing. These brain patterns characterizations could be useful for chess training or clinicians in the field of neuroscience.",

For instance, when learning how to play a board game, usually one of the first concepts learned is how the game ends, i.e. the actions that lead to a terminal state (win, lose or draw). The advantage of learning end-games first is that once the actions which lead to a terminal state are understood, it becomes possible to incrementally learn the consequences of actions that are further away from a terminal state -we call this an end-game-first curriculum. Currently the state-of-the-art machine learning player for general board games, AlphaZero by Google DeepMind, does not employ a structured training curriculum; instead learning from the entire game at all times. By employing an end-game-first training curriculum to train an AlphaZero inspired player, we empirically show that the rate of learning of an artificial player can be improved during the early stages of training when compared to a player not using a training curriculum.",

H. Hardy [4, pg. 17] estimated the game tree size (number of legal games) of Chess to be 10 10 50 or \"in any case a second order exponential\", but gave no reasoning. Claude Shannon wrote a seminal paper [9] on computer Chess. Based on master games collected by the psychologist Adriaan de Groot, he estimated \u2248 10 3 options per (white, black) move pair, and that an average game is \u2248 80 plies (half-moves). Thus, he surmised that the game tree size (and game tree complexity) is at least \u2248 10 120 . This Shannon number is often compared to the number of atoms in the observable universe \u2248 10 80 .",

Concrete presents several benefits for being used in this way, in particular with integrated electronic systems. This paper deals with smart concrete through a small size example, a chess game, i.e. board and pawns, to illustrate the potential applications on a larger scale in the field of construction. Different kind of sensors can be used in concrete construction. After comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each, magnetic sensors have been chosen to equip the concrete chessboard, handcrafted in the present work. The concrete used is UHPC (Ultra high performance concrete fiber reinforced or not), a new type of concrete with special properties, for the benefits of its mechanical strength and deformation, self-levelling workability and aesthetic surface rendering. Chess pawns and chess board have been cast with a specific protocol to embed the magnets and the sensor inside the concrete, by taking into account both its flocculation and setting times. Results of the tests show the feasibility to use magnetic sensors in concrete systems and show a good transmission of the magnetic signal through the concrete, which is very promising for further development of new concrete smart systems, that are easy and rentable to implement. The permeability of concrete to magnetic fields, robustness and sensitivity of sensor are the advantages of this application.",

With a group of amateur chess players (n = 100), the current study addressed two interrelated aims. First, we assessed whether the three broad PEN personality factors (psychoticism, extraversion, and neuroticism), and emotion regulation traits (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) differentiated chess players from the general population. Second, we compared the association of domain knowledge and personality/emotion traits with chess skill. The main findings indicated that chess players scored lower in neuroticism and higher in expressive suppression compared with the general population. Moreover, chess knowledge related in a greater extent with chess skill than personality/emotion regulation traits, even though extraversion explained additional variability in chess skill. Overall, the findings suggest that nonability traits may be influential in the selection of the chess environment. Besides, the findings corroborate the stronger impact of cognitive ability than personality traits on intellectual performance found in other domains.",

For instance, for every 100 male players with the attainment level of Candidate Master, there are about 48, 47, 38, 4, 3, and 2 female players in Vietnam, Georgia, China, US (Japan), France (Sweden), and Denmark (Finland), respectively. Noting these large gender discrepancies, this paper constructs a crosscountry panel to explore the determinants of these gaps. Controlling for main economic development indicators and several measures of gender equality, a legacy of command economy is found to be the most significant predictor of a smaller gender gap in competitive chess across countries.

The idea that machines could be made to play this game is very old and there is considerable literature devoted to this problem which has a long and amusing history, including the well known specious machines which were operated by humans hidden inside the alleged machinery. We shall mention merely an article by C. Shannon on the problem of coding for machines which could play chess. There is an account by Turing of a computing machine which actually played a game of chess. One game played by his computer is given in the book Faster than Thought by Bowden. Recently, an article in the Russian newspaper Pravda mentioned the fact that a computing machine in Moscow had been coded to play the game of chess. No detailed account was given either of the method by which this game was coded nor of the results of such play beyond a statement that a fair chess player is able to beat the machine."

Against a background of the history of business games, we first try to characterize the present development of these games. A few management games are described in some detail, and a number of others are mentioned only briefly. The differences between general and functional business games are discussed. Present uses of management games as a teaching device are surveyed and evaluated. Some hypotheses regarding the relations between the design and administrative characteristics of a business game and its educational properties are also formulated. What might be a major improvement over existing management games, here named the \"game case\", is then suggested. In the concluding portion of this paper, the potential use of management games as a laboratory for business and social science research is surveyed. Some methodological problems which would arise from research uses of business games are also discussed.",
         "Introduction": "During the past four years, management decision games have become increasingly popular as a means of entertaining executives, as a training device for management, and as a teaching aid in university business schools. Before trying to assess the role of management games in business education and their potential for both teaching and research, it is desirable to view them in historical perspective. Direct outgrowths of military war games, business games were made possible by recent developments in operations research and electronic computers."

The preliminary planning led to the decision to use a variable depth search, terminating at either an arbitrary maximum, or at a stable position. Two schemes of controlling material balance are discussed. Of major significance is the use of the \"alpha-beta\" heuristic, a method of pruning the tree of moves. This heuristic makes use of values obtained at previous branches in the tree to eliminate the necessity to search obviously worse branches later.",
         "Introduction": "This thesis describes a chess playing program for the IBM 7090 computer. Although chess programs have been previously written, none of these played what could be considered \"good chess\". Before commencing work on our chess program, we studied the report published by Newell, Shaw and Simon covering previous attempts, such as the Los Alamos program, and Bernstein's program at IBM. The chess group, consisting of Messrs. Berlekamp, Niessen, Lieberman and Kotok, inherited routines for generating and making legal moves. With these as a basis, we decided to write a three move mate solving program for the purpose of familiarizing ourselves with the existing routines, and to come in contact with many of the problems we would later face in the actual general playing program. The three move mate program was completed in the spring of 1960. It was given problems from actual games, and successfully solved many of them. The three move mate program was written for the IBM 704, which was removed from the MIT Computation Center in the summer of 1960. Due to incompatibility with the incoming 709, the project was dropped at the end of the spring term of 1960."

To the knowledge of this author, no official rules for Kriegsspiel have ever been set down. Because the game is essentially wll defined, howver, this lack has resulted in only minor variations in the rules as observed in different locations. Two opponents play a game of chess in suCh a way as to prevent eaCh from seeing the position of the other's pieces and pawns. Since, under the rules of Chess, the position of one's opponent often determines the legality of a move (one cannot move into check, for example), a third person, called the referee, is present in Krlegssplel to prevent illegal moves and to announce to both players such events as the capture of pieces of pawnso This paper describes a computer program called UMPIRE that performs all the functions of an actual 11vereferee for the game of Kriegsspiel."

The entire area of artificial intelligence may be thought of as research in non-numeric data processing, as may the area of real-time simulations. In the overlap of these two categories are the gameplaying machines. Computers have been programmed to play all or part of many different games such as Chess ~, Bridge 2, NIM 3, Dominoes 4, and Checkers 5."

Full use is made of the so called \"alpha-beta\" pruning and several forms of forward pruning to restrict the spread of the move tree and to permit the program to look ahead to a much greater depth than it otherwise could do. While still unable to outplay checker masters, the program's playing ability has been greatly improved.",
         "Introduction": "Limited progress has been made in the development of an improved book-learning technique and in the optimization of playing strategies as applied to the checker playing program described in an earlier paper with this same title.' Because of the sharpening in our understanding and the substantial improvements in playing ability that have resulted from these recent studies, a reporting at this time seems desirable. Unfortunately, the most basic limitation of the known machine learning techniques, as previously outlined, has not yet been overcome nor has the program been able to outplay the best human checker players?"

Game-playing on computers serves a similar function. It can teach us something about the structure of thought processes and the theory of struggle and has the advantage over economic modelling that the rules and objectives are clear-cut. If the machine wins tournaments it must be a good player.",
         "Introduction": "It is pertinent to ask in what way a good chess program would take us beyond the draughts program of A. L. Samuel (see Appendix B). The answer is related to the much greater complication of chess, the much larger number of variations and possible positions. In fact, the number of possible chess positions is about the cube or fourth power of the number of possible draughts positions (see Appendix E). Samuel was able to make considerable use of the storage of thousands of positions that had occurred in the previous experience of the machine, and this led to a very useful increase in the depth of analysis of individual positions. The value of this device depends on the probability that, at any moment in the analysis, we run into a position that has already been analysed and stored. If the expected number of previously analysed and stored positions on an analysis tree exceeds unity, then the expected effective number of positions on the tree is infinite! This remark is of course based on an over-simplified model, as is clear since the total number of possible chess or draughts positions is finite. The remark is also somewhat misleading, since an 'infinite' tree might be deep at the wrong places; but it does give a little insight into the effect of storing positions. (See also (a) on p. 92 and Appendix H, p. 114.) Whereas it is useful to store thousands of positions in draughts, in chess it would be necessary to store millions or billions of positions in order to gain a comparable advantage. Presumably the main advantage of storing positions in draughts accrues from the opening and early middle-game; and in chess, by storing millions of positions, the machine could gain an opening advantage. Apart from this, I have believed for a very long time that a good chess program would need to make use of essentially the same methods as those used by men. The difficulty, the interest, and the challenge, is to formalise exactly what it is that men do when they play chess."

This system was assembled as a pre-FORTRAN compiler similar in principle to that of FORMAC. TPS and FORTRAN IV statements are used together for writing programs. In the present implementation, each TPS command must be preceded by an asterisk (*) in the first column to distinguish it from a regular FORTRAN statement. TPS has the two-fold purpose of being a language for manipulating tree-structured data formations and also encompassing machine-learning capability."

Performance figures are given for six variations of the game of kalah. A quantity called \"depth ratio\" is derived which is a measure of the efficiency of a search procedure. A theoretical limit of efficiency is calculated and it is shown experimentally that the dynamic ordering procedure approaches that limit.",

Three chess players of varying strength -from master to novice -were confronted with two tasks: ( 1) A perception task, where the player reproduces a chess position in plain view, and (2) de Groot's ( 1965) short-term recall task, where the player reproduces a chess position after viewing it for 5 sec. The successive glances at the position in the perceptual task and long pauses in tbe memory task were used to segment the structures in the reconstruction protocol. The size and nature of these structures were then analyzed as a function of chess skill."

On the IBM 360-65, COKO lII plays a minimal chess game at the rate of .2 see cpu time per move, with a level close to lower chess club play. A selective tree searching procedure controlled by tactical chess logistics allows a deployment of multiple minimal game calculations to achieve some optimal move selection. The tree searching algorithms are the heart of COKO's effectiveness, yet they are conceptually simple. In addition, an interesting phenomenon called a tree searching catastrophe has plagued COKO's entire development just as it troubles a human player. Standard exponential growth is curbed to a large extent by the definition and trimming of the Fischer set. A clear distinction between tree pruning and selective tree searching is also made. Representation of the chess environment is described along with a strategical preanalysis procedure that maps the Lasker regions. Specific chess algorithms are described which could be used as a command structure by anyone desiring to do some chess program experimentation. A comparison is made of some mysterious actions of human players and COKO HI.",

The use of a brute force selective tree searching procedure yields an order of magnitude improvement in performance at the standard rate of 3 min./move. Perhaps three orders of magnitude additional improvement is needed to defeat the world champion, a gap which must be bridged, i f ever, by programming more chess knowledge into the machine.

         "Introduction": "In most problems of artificial intellegence an exhaustive search is an important (we think, main) method of choosing a solution among certain alternatives. The central problem, which arrises here is the problem of search reduction without prejudice to the quality of solution. A search reduction is called absolute if the search graph is certainely lessened, and it is called heuristic if reduction of the search graph depends on the good luck. (We do not consider here search reduction techniques which may lead to the loss of solution, although they are sometimes also called heuristic). The subject of the theory of exhaustive search (considered as part of the artificial intelligence theory) should be, naturally, heuristic search reductions. In this connection the following problems arrise: the problem of formalisation, the problem of inventing a search reduction method, (heuristic by itself) the problem of analysis of a reduction method. A analysis consists apparently of the following parts: an applicability domain, uniqueness results (under such and such conditions no other method exists), results on optimal effect, examples of the absence of effect, results on \"rentability\" of a method whether the time spent to answer question: \"To reduce or not\" is saved by essential reduction of the size of searched set). In the present talk we ohose a simple (but important) case of exhaustive search -namely minimax problemsand method as a heuristic search reduction method, to make a part of such an analysis. We show that if a corresponding method is used for a too wide class of problems, then it is the only search reduction method for this class (more precisely it majorates all other methods)."

To this end, the technique of partitioning recall and reproduction data into chunks on the basis of inter-response times (IRTs) (introduced in their work on chess by "

The developers of the Kaissa program, using adaptive methods for reducing scans, tried to obtain in the least possible time a result equivalent to the result following a complete scan by the algorithm. The developers of the Pioner' program tried to simulate the thought processes of the most expert human players of chess as a muitijump control system, which would permit them to obtain a small scan tree.

For trees of depth 2, the expected number is oforder O(NHN); for trees of depth 3, the expected number is of order O(N2).

It can find combinations for which it is necessary to look more than twenty ply ahead. The paper describes the methods used for analyzing a situation and for modifying unsuccessful plans. Then we examine some results found by the program.",
         "Introduction": "Artificial Intelligence programs generate generally a very large tree. Heuristics eliminate many branches, but they select when a node is developed for the first time; therefore if some branch is eliminated, it is often impossible to consider it again later. But it is very difficult to choose branches in that way: either we elimiaate important branches or we keep all the branches and the tree is too large. It is frequently unnatural to consider many branches when we find them for the first time; but, after developing some other subtree, it becomes evident that we must consider them for correcting what is wrong in this new sabtree."

A tournament-simulation task required subjects to play 10 hands, after which a surprise test was given for the cards in each hand of the 10 deals. A memory task required that subjects reconstruct a briefly presented stimulus containing four bridge hands of either structured or unstructured arrangement. The perception task required that the subjects reconstruct stimuli similar to those used in the memory task after brief glances at the stimulus. The results confirm the findings of research on chess players in that performance in the structured components of each task varied uniformly according to level of expertise but that performance in the unstructured component of each task showed little difference in level of expertise. It was argued that bridge players with \"supranormal\" memory are able to use their prior experience to configure and chunk information in more efficient ways than players of less expertise."

Subjects were also more likely to reconstruct a typical position correctly based on partial information.

David Levy, International Chess Master from England, author of numerous books on chess, and gambler at heart, won three games, drew one, and lost one against CHESS 4.7, the world's best computer chess program. 1 In so doing, Levy won a $ 2,000 wager made in 1968 that no computer chess program would defeat him in a match during the next ten years."

         "Introduction": "Despite the numerous references to go and backgammon in the laws, diaries and novels of Heian times, the first description of shogi is not until about 1126-30 in Part 13 of the obscurely titled history book Nichureki. Whereas this book mentions go and backgammon but does not give the rules, it gives the moves of the pieces for shogi, says that all pieces promote to Gold on reaching the third rank, and says that reducing the opponent's forces to a solitary King counts as a win. The pieces are the same as in modern shogi except that no mention is made of a Rook or Bishop. Nor is anything said about the number of pieces, the size of the board or the initial set-up. Two reconstructions of this Heian shogi have been suggested by Masukawa Koichi. One version has only an 8 x 8 board; the other has a 9 x 8 board with an extra Gold on the back rank as in modern shogi. This first Japanese form of chess, in whichever version, is clearly cognate with the other forms of chess known throughout the world, especially in South-East Asia. The distinctively Japanese feature of drops was not then known but it is significant that the concept of a large promotion zone had already been introduced. Whether promotion was compulsory, however, is not clear. The Nichureki also describes a larger shogi. It says:"

Dr. McCarthy awarded the trophies at a conference luncheon on Wednesday, October 31, and called for placing greater stress on the experimental aspects of the tournament. He encouraged the tournament organizers to require programs to print out more of the important information leading up to their choice of moves. This would permit a clearer understanding of why the computers play as they do. Koltanowski and Euwe mixed with the participants and from time to time came to the stage to assist David Levy. They commented on the games and dipped into their large reservoir of chessrelated stories and jokes. In addition to the chess tournament, ACM 79 was the scene of a most unusual event on October 27, 1979. An exhibition chess game was held between David Levy and a unique team consisting of CHESS 4.9 and David Slate. Before we go on with our coverage, we wish to assure you that man won!"

Beginning simply as a form of recreation, this game was to evolve into a profound ritual, a drama for ultimate stakes. Called senet or \"passing,\" the game was based on the movement of draughtsmen across a board consisting of 30 squares arranged into three parallel rows of ten squares each. Two contestants strategically maneuvered their teams of draughtsmen through these squares on the throw of dice-like casting sticks or bones, freely passing each other in an attempt to gain the position of final superiority at the edge of the board. For 3,000 years these players jockeyed for position until the advent of the Christian era when senet died out and its detailed rules passed into oblivion."

The method also applies to decision making in living systems at the level of the group. Our approach to prediction deals with the inputs (know-how of the players) of a system (the chess board and its psychological surrounding environment), the transformation of the input within the system through actual play, and with its outputs (outcome of the match). Thus our task is to assess the quality of the input by deriving a relative index of power of the players by identifying (with the assistance of grandmasters through a questionnaire) the relevant factors whose totality may determine the outcome. We then use this index to assess the kind of output (win, draw, or loss) that it would produce over a set of several encounters in a match. The outcome of our analysis is an estimate of the total number of games that two given players would play, together with the numbers of games won by each player. We also analyze the sensitivity of the results to changes in the expectations of the competitors.",
         "Introduction": "UR PURPOSE in this paper is to explore 0 through an example the role of technical competence and behavior in predicting the outcome of a coinpetitive situation. Of course, factors arising from uncontrollable natural events (e.g., bad weather), and from human intervention (e.g., referee error) could have a marked effect on the outcome of a game. However, in most competition, an effort is usually made to minimize the effect of natural causes to avoid unfair outside intervention."

This has been carried out by constructing a program, PARADISE (PAttern Recognition Applied to Directing SEarch), which finds the best move in tactically sharp middle game positions from the games of chess masters. It encodes a large body of knowledge in the form of production rules. The actions of the rules post concepts in the data base while the conditions match patterns in the chess position and data base. The program uses the knowledge base to discover plans during static analysis and to guide a small tree search which con~ms that a particular plan is best. The search is \"small\" in the sense that the size of the search tree is of the same order of magnitude as a human master's search tree (tens and hundreds of nodes, not thousands to hundreds of thousands as in many computer chess programs).",

Chess has been one of the most popular domains for AI research, yet brute force searching programs with little chess knowledge play better chess than programs with more chess knowledge.

The reason for this later became apparent; it was running on a machine that was 10 times faster than the one it usually ran on. This made it possible to search on average a little more that one ply deeper. This resulted in at least a 200 point (one grade) improvement in its performance."

Recall was more accurate for younger players, with the gap widening as viewing time increased. Interpolated processing decreased accuracy and increased retrieval time equally in the two groups. Measures of chunking indicated no age-related differences. These results imply that there is an age-related deficit in encoding but not retrieval for visual short-term memory. Since young and old were affected equivalents by interpolated processing, it appears likely that they have similar memory consolidation functions. Since the players were equally skilled, the results contradict the view that skill in chess derives primarily from encoding ability.",

The suggestion therefore arises that mastery consists of recognizing configurations that are associated with plausible moves. This approach is tested by comparing the memory scores and move-choice protocols of players in six skill categories, using random chess positions. Contrary to any strong form of recognitionassociation hypothesis, differences in chess skill are shown to persist although memory differences are abolished. It is further shown that the moves selected are not based on those few pieces that are remembered. Skill-related differences in the accuracy of positional evaluations also occur, but they are less marked than in earlier results. An alternative approach to chess skill seems appropriate, in which memory effects may function at the evaluation phase.",

         "Introduction": "Chess, checkers, kalah, and go are popular examples of two-person \"zero-sum\" games--that is, games in which one player's losses are his opponent's gains. There are a number of methods for programming a computer to play such games. The simplest (and most successful) programs have as their basis \"brute-force\" search, in which an exhaustive examination of all possible sequences of moves is carried out until terminal positions are reached (no more legal moves). By subsequently backing up through this tree of moves, a player can find the best move for his side by using the minimax algorithm. Minimax search assumes that the players will always select the alternative that is best for them in any given position. The advantage of such an approach is that it guarantees perfect play; a \"winning\" position will always be won, and a drawn position will at least be drawn. This strategy works admirably for games such as tictactoe, but most interesting games are too large to be handled in this fashion. In chess, for example, de Groot [DEGR65] has estimated that the number of positions that could be explored is 38 ~."

Global mathematical models of system performance were typically constructed in forms permitting multi-dimensional representation in systems of orthogonal co-ordinate axes. Numerical parameters were then automatically tuned at run time in response to sensed deviations from computed criteria of optimality. This scheme embraces classical adaptive control, along with many studies of machine learning in games and game-like situations.

The motivation for investigating such methods comes from the fact that searching to a fixed depth causes difficult problems (e.g. the horizon effect). The first section deals with certain improvements of the quiescence search and a demonstration of their beneficial effects. The method of not counting moves as a ply of depth is investigated then and the results of extending it somewhat are reported. As this method seems to be too simple nevertheless, a more general model tor extending the horizon of the full-width search to variable depth is proposed.",
         "Introduction": "Although most of today's better chess programs perform a simple quiescence search and do not count replies to check as a ply of depth there is a fundamental philosophy to search every branch to the same depth. The main reason for this lies in the tact that in chess it is very difficult to discriminate good moves from bad ones statically without error. Moreover it has been shown consistantly, that programs which perform forward pruning are inferior. They often prune moves at a lower level which seem to be bad, but would prove good, deeper in the tree (e.g. sacrifices). On the contrary, brute-force programs can discover everything within their horizon as their search is full-width. A thorough discussion of advantages and disadvantages of this mernethod was given by Berliner in 1981 "

The distinguishing characteristics of this work are the large numbers of examples employed in forming the concepts and the computational efficiency of the classification rules discovered in this way as compared with other classification methods for the same task.

Previous work on assessing their performance has concentrated on the benefits of individual enhancements or a few combinations. However, each enhancement should not be taken in isolation; one would like to find the combination that provides the greatest reduction in tree size. Results indicate that the history heuristic and transposition tables significantly out-perform other alpha-beta enhancements in application generated game trees.

This allows CHUNKER to reason about positions that come up in the search that would otherwise have to be handled by means of additional search. Thus the program is able to solve the most difficult problem of its present domain (a problem that would require 45 ply of search and on the order of 1013 years of CPU time to be solved by the best of present day chess programs) in 18 ply and one minute of CPU time. Further, CHUNKER is undoubtedly the world's /~remost expert in its domain, and has discovered 2 mistakes in the literature and has been instrume~tul in discovering a new theorem about the domain that allows the assessing of positions with a new degree of ease and confidence. In this paper we show how the libraries are compiled, how CHUNKER works, and discuss our plans for extending it to play the whole domain of king and pawn endings.",

         "Abstract": "Communication is a basic problem when using VLSI technology to implement large parallel circuits. Valuable chip area must be used to run wires connecting components on a chip and current packaging technology restricts the amount of communication that can cross chip boundaries. This paper presents a large parallel architecture for generating moves in chess and shows how it can be restructured to reduce communication and permit a straightforward VLSI implementation without any performance loss. The result is a move generator comprising 64 identical custom chips performing at a rate of 500,000 moves per second, performance that is comparable to the best existing move generator.",
         "Introduction": "The development of VLSI technology offers tremendous possibilities for constructing large parallel circuits. Unfortunately, the problem of communication can place strong restrictions on the architectures that can actually be built. Large scale parallel processing usually implies large communication bandwidth and communication is generally very expensive in VLSI implementations whereas circuit devices are cheap. This paper describes a novel parallel architecture for a chess move generator. In this architecture, a relatively small number of extra devices are added in order to greatly reduce the communication costs. This architecture is interesting for several reasons. It is effective: in terms of absolute performance, it matches or exceeds all other current designs. It includes features that make it an integral part of a chess-playing system so that it is possible to actually use the performance in a real system. Finally, it is an architecture that lends itself to VLSI implementation. By reducing the communication costs, it is possible to use VLSI technology to build the major components of the move generator."

At the time of his death, in 1929, when he was only forty years old, Masters of the Chessboard was not quite finished. A talented editor completed the job. The book contains seventy master games, each one carefully annotated and a joy to replay. But they are not the reason for the book's distinction. They are old games now, and no longer represent the best of chess. What makes Reti 's book special is his larger vision of the game, which he communicates with a grace and skill few others have matched."

For neither casual players (Experiment 1) nor tournament players (Experiment 2) did the placed pieces improve positioning of the remaining pieces. This result parallels the now standard finding of no facilitation through part-set cuing in the recall of word lists, and it bears on the question of whether this finding is due to memory for word lists not being organized or to the failure of the part-set cuing procedure to detect its organization. Specifically, to the extent that we can be more sure of memory for chess positions being organized than we can be of memory for word lists being organized, the present results provide evidence that the part-set cuing procedure does not test for memory organization.",

Ni dans le cas des joueurs occasionnels (experience I), ni dans le cas des joueurs de tournois (experience 2) le fait que des pieces soient deja en place n'a facilite la mise en place des pieces restantes. Ce resultat est similaire a un autre resultat, desormais tres bien etabli, et qui montre que dans le cas du rappel de listes de mots, le fait de donner des indices partiels ne produit pas d'effet facilitateur. Notre recherche repose la question, de savoir si ce resultat est du au fait que la memoire des listes de mots n'a pas d'organisation ou au fait que la procedure d'indices partiels ne permet pas de detecter cette organisation. Plus specifiquement, en autant que Ton peut etre plus certain que la memoire des positions d'echecs est organisee, que l'on ne peut 1'etre dans le cas de la memoire des listes de mots, nos resultats sont une preuve que la procedure d'indices partiels n'est pas un test de l'organisation de la memoire."

There are two major techniques used in today's programs to take advantage of this fact: hash tables (used in full-width programs), and subtree merging (used in programs that maintain the whole tree). Hash tables in particular have proven extremely successful, typically giving speedups of 2 or more "

This paper obtains the expected number of tests required when the elements are independent, identically distributed, random variables. For matrices 50 by 50 or smaller, the expected number of tests required by the row-by-row calculation can be at most 42% greater than the number for the optimal calculation.

In particular, the Principal Variation splitting method has been implemented, and experimental results are presented which show how such refinements as progressive deepening, narrow window searching and the use of memory tables affect the performance of multiprocessor based chess-playing programs. When dealing with parallel processing systems, communication delays are perhaps the greatest source of lost time. Therefore, an implementation of our tree decomposition based algorithm is presented that can operate with a limited amount of communication within a network of processors. This system has almost negligible search overhead, and so the principal basis for comparison is the communication overhead, based on a new mathematical model of this component.",
         "Introduction": "When sequential versions of the alpha-beta tree searching algorithm are adapted for use on a parallel processing system, the speed-up (reduction in search time) is notoriously less than the number of processors in the system. These losses are due to search overhead and communication overhead. The search overhead is algorithm dependent, since it is defined as the extra work that a parallel algorithm carries out compared to its sequential counterpart. Since an alpha-beta search uses accumulated information to determine when cutoffs are to occur, a parallel implementation may have one processor still calculating the better cutoff value that another processor could use to terminate its execution. Thus the total work done, and hence the search overhead, may be higher. In contrast, communication overhead results from the necessary exchange of information between processors, and is therefore dependent on the system configuration as well as the algorithm. Thus, parallel alpha-beta is potentially susceptible to search overhead losses, and compensating for this overhead may entail major communication delays."

One method is based on the minimax principle, eificiently implemented as the alpha-beta algorithm.

The game is over when a position is reached that qualifies as 'terminal'by the rules of the gamefor example, mate in chess. The rules also determine what is the outcome of the game that has ended in this terminal position."

Defined is an expert system, RETRO, whose domain of application is retrograde-analysis chess problems. This type of problem, chess logic problems as they are sometimes called, differs from the conventional type of chess problem in that it is concerned only with the past history of the game, and what may be deduced about it. Typically, a (human) solution proceeds by the solver asking himself a series of questions in the form of a Socratic dialogue until a solution emerges. RETRO makes use of a frame-like approach to determine the questions that must be asked to effect a solution. Although RETRO cannot solve any conceivable retrograde-analysis problem, the approach taken has been designed to be of general applicability.",

There were rather few diagrams in the book showing the position on the board and sometimes for more than twenty moves only the usual textual chess notation (e.g., c2-c4, Kh8xg7) was used to describe the progress of the game. macros into the notation scheme of English or any other language should cause no major problems.)"

A system (GINA) has been developed that uses experience-based learning to improve its own base performance level for the game of Othello. A variety of traditional (non-learning) Othello game playing programs have been collected to provide a rich source of ''experiences'' for GINA. An initial set of experiments has been designed and run in an attempt to understand better the strengths and weaknesses of experiencebased learning from the point of view of skill refinement (taking less time to perform at a given level of play) and from the point of view of skill enhancement (higher quality play). Preliminary results suggest that in this context experienced-based learning can be a highly effective means for improving both the speed and quality of play without having to accumulate experience bases of intolerable size.",
         "Introduction": "We use the term experience-based learning to characterize the kind of learning that takes place as a consequence of attempting to perform a complex task, evaluating the results of that attempt, and ''remembering'' certain aspects of that experience in order to ''improve'' subsequent task performance. Humans clearly exhibit this kind of learning in tasks as diverse as medical diagnosis, fault isolation in man-made systems, theorem proving, writing programs, and playing games. The authors' interest in experience-based learning comes from their own experiences in designing and implementing (non-learning) second-generation expert systems for fault isolation of complex, man-made systems.

The algorithm's simple control strategy and strong performance in complicated positions make it a viable alternative to the principal variation splitting algorithm (PVSA). Processors independently carry out iteratively deepening searches on separate subsets of moves. The iterative deepening is unsynchronized-one processor might be in the middle of the fifth iteration while another is in the middle of the sixth. Narrow windows serve to diminish the importance of backing up a score to the root of the tree as quickly as possible, one of the principal objectives of the PVSA. Speedups measured on one, two, four, and eight computers are reported.",

With the strongest field ever assembled for a computer chess event, including current World Champion CRAY BLITZ and former World Champion BELLE, CHIPTEST-M overpowered the field of 12 with a perfect 4-0 performance to capture the $2000 first place prize. En route to winning the championship, the program defeated CRAY BLITZ in the third round and then routinely disposed of SUN PHOENIX in the final fourth round. CRAY BLITZ finished in second place, while SUN PHOENIX settled for third. Both won three games and lost one, but CRAY BLITZ was awarded second place based on tiebreaking points. BELLE withdrew from the tournament after three rounds when a hardware problem surfaced.",

Most of these games, however, have been designed in a rather ad hoc manner because many of their basic components have never been adequately defined. In this paper some deficiencies in the standard model of computer games, the minimax model, are pointed out and the issues that a general theory must address are outlined. Most of the discussion is done in the context of control strategies, or sets of criteria for move selection. A survey of control strategies brings together results from two fields: implementations of real games and theoretical predictions derived on simplified game-trees. The interplay between these results suggests a series of open problems that have arisen during the course of both analytic experimentation and practical experience as the basis for a formal theory.",

The goal is to build a system being able to dialogue about a chess game as humans do, i.e. commenting in a masterly way the score of a game. In this context the architecture of a knowledge-based system for the middlegame and a development interface called METAChess, is described. This interface gives the user full control on both the operating level (game rules, input/output) and the planning level ( strategy and tactics advices). The project is presently in an initial phase: a first experimental activity was done using MRS and is being continued using PROLOG.",

         "Abstract": "Learning how to make decisions in a domain is a critical aspect of intelligent planning behavior. The ability of a planner to adapt its decision-making to a domain depends in part upon its ability to optimize the tradeoff between the sophistication of its decision procedures and their cost. Since it is difficult to optimize this tradeoff on a priori grounds alone, we propose that a planner start with a relatively simple set of decision procedures, and add complexity in response to experience gained in the application of its decision-making to real-world problems. Our model of this adaptation process is based on the explanation of failures, in that it is the analysis of bad decisions that drives the improvement of the decision procedures. We have developed a test-bed system for the implementation of planning models employing such an approach, and have demonstrated the ability of such a model to improve its procedure for projecting the effects of its moves in chess.",
         "Introduction": "The ability to plan effectively involves many different forms of reasoning: projecting the effects of actions in a current or hypothetical situation, deciding which goal to pursue from among the many that might be pursued at any given time, constructing sequences of actions that can achieve a given goal, determining whether to execute such a sequence, and so on. By and large, most research on planning in Al has concentrated on those aspects of planning that in vol ve reasoning about actions, and more specifically, on how sequences of actions can 1 This research was supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, monitored by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, under contract number F49620-88-C-0058, and in part by the Office of Naval Research under contract number N0014-85-K-010. be constructed to achieve particular and well-defined goals. Considerably less attention has been devoted to those aspects of planning that we might term decisionmaking: Deciding whether (or when) to pursue a given goal, or whether to use a given plan for the goal, or for that matter whether even to consider the goal in the first place."

Over that period, computer chess has fallen from the position of being a prominent research application in artificial intelligence to a peripheral area. In this paper, we take a retrospective look at what has been accomplished, in order to understand where the field is today and where it is headed tomorrow. Whereas the past has often been clouded by engineering passing as science, misspent effort for short-term gains, and research results with little applicability to other domains, there is evidence that computer chess is emerging from the shadow of its past and may now be recapturing some of its lost stature in the research world. _ Chess is to artificial intelligence as the fruit fly is to genetics.",
         "Introduction": "Research in computer chess has progressed over that past three decades to the point where programs will soon be grandmaster strength. Superficially this accomplishment seems impressive. However, the building of a chess program that is better than all humans is a scientific pursuit, and it is relevant to ask what the lasting scientific contributions of achieving this result are. Perhaps the ends justify the means, but what are the means by which the computer chess community strives for this lofty goal? Rather than evaluating the accomplishments of computer chess research, in this paper we consider the methods by which the results have been obtained."

It describes an empirical study that evaluates three methods for solving this problem: explanation-based generalization (EBG), multiple example explanation-based generalization (mEBG), and a new method, induction over explanations (IOE). The study demonstrates that the two existing methods (EBG and mEBG) exhibit two shortcomings: (a) they rarely identify the correct definition, and (b) they are brittle in that their success depends greatly on the choice of encoding of the domain theory rules. The study demonstrates that the new method, IOE, does not exhibit these shortcomings. This method applies the domain theory to construct explanations from multiple training examples as in mEBG, but forms the concept definition by employing a similarity-based generalization policy over the explanations. IOE has the advantage that an explicit domain theory can be exploited to aid the learning process, the dependence on the initial encoding of the domain theory is significantly reduced, and the correct concepts can be learned from few examples. The study evaluates the methods in the context of an implemented system, called Wyl2, which learns a variety of concepts in chess including \"skewer\" and \"knight-fork.\"",

After the theoretical discussion, some practical results obtained by running two implementations of the PVS algorithm on a 30-processor tightly coupled shared memory machine are given to show the speedup obtained by parallel processing.",
         "Introduction": "The depth d minimax tree searching problem is well-suited to parallel analysis since there are many separate branches in the tree that are independent of each other. The granularity of the problem is controlled by the appropriate selection of the depth at which the tree is divided into parallel tasks. If coarse granularity is desired, dividing the tree at the root or at levels close to the root results in subtrees with large numbers of nodes requiring a large amount of work to examine. If fine granularity is desired, dividing the tree at levels near terminal positions results in subtrees with few nodes requiring a small amount of work to examine."

The results of the first two experiments showed that the skilled chess players are better at recalling game and random positions. This contradicts the standard finding that they perform better only in game positions. In the third experiment, the memory load was increased by increasing the number of positions to be recalled simultaneously from one to four positions. Skilled subjects are still far better at recalling game positions, but they score no more than moderately skilled subjects in recalling four random positions.",

Implementations suffer primarily from the synchronization and search overheads of parallelization. This paper describes a parallel (Y@ searching program that achieves high performance through the use of four different types of processes: Controllers, Searchers, TableManagers, and Scouts. Synchronization is reduced by having all Searchers apply the PVSplit algorithm on the subtrees they search and having a Controller process reassigning idle processes to help out busy ones. Search overhead is reduced by having two types of parallel table management: global Table Managers and the periodic merging and redistribution of local tables. Experiments show that nine processors can achieve 5.67-fold speedups but beyond that, additional processors provide diminishing returns. Given that additional resources are of little benefit, speculative computing is introduced as a means of extending the effective number of processors that can be utilized. Scout processes speculatively search ahead in the tree looking for interesting features and communicate this information back to the ~$3 program. In this way, the effective search depth is extended. These ideas have been tested experimentally and empirically as part of the chess program ParaPhoenk",

A comprehensive set of experiments is reported which tries all combinations of enhancements to determine which one yields the best performance. Previous work on assessing their performance has concentrated on the benefits of individual enhancements or a few combinations. However, each enhancement should not be taken in isolation; one would like to find the combination that provides the greatest reduction in tree size. Results indicate that the history heuristic and transposition tables significantly out-perform other alpha-beta enhancements in application generated game trees. For trees up to depth 8, when taken together, they account for over 99% of the possible reductions in tree size, with the other enhancements yielding insignificant gains.",

The networks were trained by \"back-propagation\" learning of a large set of sample positions evaluated by a human expert. A game-playing system using such a network evaluation function achieves an intermediate-to-advanced level of performance, and is significantly better than the best available commercial program. In order to achieve this level of performance, certain novel protocols for the training procedure and input coding scheme design were required. These protocols are expected to be of general utility in applications of network learning to largescale \"real-world\" problems.",
         "Introduction": "A potentially quite useful testing ground for studying issues of knowledge representation and learning in connectionist (\"neural\") networks can be found in the domain of game playing. Board games such as chess, go, backgammon, and Othello entail considerable sophistication and complexity at the advanced level, and mastery of expert concepts and strategies often takes years of intense study and practice for humans. However, the complexities in board games are embedded in relatively \"clean\" structured tasks with well-defined rules of play, and well-defined criteria for success and failure. This makes them amenable to automated play, and in fact most of these games have been extensively studied with conventional computer science techniques. Thus, direct comparisons of the results of network learning can be made with more conventional approaches."

The expected-outcome model proposes that the proper evaluation of a game-tree node is the expected value of the game's outcome given random play from that node on. Although this characterization may appear somewhat naive, experiments performed on variants of tic-tac-toe, Othello, and chess, substantiate its viability node's complete minimax value (the value that would be attained by performing a minimax search to the leaves), and an heuristic function as One that estimates it L20]' Even this characterization, however, is generally viewed as an implicit property of the function rather than as an as a general paradigm of evaluator design. First, expected-outcome is considered in its ideal form, where it is shown to be a powerful heuristic. Next, the ability of a simple random sampler that estimates expected-outcome to outduel a standard Othello evaluator is demonstrated. Finally, the sampler is combined with a linear regression procedure to produce efficient expected-outcome estimators. Overall, the expected-outcome model of two-player games is shown to be precise, accurate, easily estimable, efficiently calculable, and domain-independent.",

Typically these extensions are based on static, domain-dependent knowledge. This paper describes a modification of brute-force search, singular extensions, that allows extensions to be identified in a dynamic, domain-independent, low-overhead manner. Singular extensions, when implemented in a chess-playing program, resulted in significant performance improvements.",

Such things include the fact that brute-force searchers are very tenacious defenders, and that mucn that humans make a great deal of can be found, essentially en passant by a searching program. The reason that ideas such as board control do not appear in major chess programs is that board control correlates very highly with piece placement. If one side manages to place its pieces well while the other does not, this almost certainly means that the former side dominates the board in such a way as to prevent the opponent from achieving normal good squares for his pieces."

A player may recall a previous game to either obtain the best move (if he has previously seen the identical position) or suggest a best move (if similar to others seen). However, game-playing programs operate in isolation, relying on the combination of search and programmed knowledge to discover the best move, even in positions well-known to humans. At best, programs have only a limited amount of information about previous games. This paper discusses enhancing a chess-playing program to discover and extract implicit knowledge from previously played grandmaster games, and using it to improve the chess program's performance. During a game, a database of positions is queried looking for identical or similar positions to those on the board. Similarity measures are determined by chunking the position and using these patterns as indices into the database. Relevant information is subsequently passed back to the chess program and used in its decision making process. As the number of games in the database increases, the \"experience\" available to the program improves the likelihood that relevant, useful information can be found for a given position.",
         "Introduction": "For many subject areas requiring skills, a large body of previous experience is usually gathered which can be used as a resource to be studied for improving one's performance. Unfortunately, most attempts at having machines mimic human behavior are primarily concerned with trying to solve the problem in isolation (usually a difficult enough task), without exploiting the available wealth of others' experience. For many disciplines, this information is not available in machine readable form. Other than using simple memory tables, few programs attempt to take advantage of the acquired wealth of human experience on a particular subject."

An overall analysis is given of how manifestations of uncertainty are dealt with in the field of computer chess. A new method of expressing uncertainty is presented which is done on the basis of a pair of point values associated with a weighting factor that indicates a preference between them. The reasoning process aiming at decisions among problem states associated with such a weighted pair is embedded in a traditional environment which requires point values. Essential components of this process are the overall (general) state of the critical position in terms of the degree of advantage and the competence of the system to judge the category of the domain-specific feature which causes the uncertainty. Finally, we present further improvements of the reasoning process which can be achieved when the requirement to back up point values is removed.",

Among various search procedures to solve such game trees, a-/3 and SSS* are perhaps most well known. Although it is proved that SSS* explores only a subset of the nodes explored by a-fl, a-fl is commonly believed to be faster in real applications, since it requires very little memory space and hence its storage management cost is low. Contrary to this folklore, however, this paper reports, using the OTHELLO game as an example, that SSS* is much faster than a-ft. It is also demonstrated that SSS* can be modified to make the required memory space controllable to some extent, while retaining the high efficiency of the original SSS*.",

Despite its lack of maturity the practice of knowledge engineering promises to have a noticeable impact on software engineering doctrine. The experimental nature of knowledge engineering goes hand-in-hand with a style of software development best characterized as 'exploratory,' which has not been much studied in traditional software engineering."

Its performance is due to a combination of factors. First, a wide variety of searching and timing techniques are used in order to increase its search depth. Furthermore, BILL efficiently uses a large amount of knowledge in its evaluation function. This efficiency is achieved through the use of pre-computed tables that can recognize hundreds of thousands of patterns in constant time. Finally, we applied Bayesian learning to combine features in BILL's evaluation function. This algorithm is automatic and optimal. It encapsulates inter-feature correlations, and directly estimates the probability of winning. These techniques are instrumental to BILL's playing strength, and we believe that they are generalizable to other domains.",

If the uncertainty about the value is to be reflected in the evaluation, which is described with probabilistic distribution or probabilities, the search process must back up distributions from leaf nodes to the root. It is shown that even though the merit value of a node is described by probabilities, \u03b1-\u03b2 bounded windows can still be used to cut off some subtrees from search when a space-efficient depth-first traversal is applied to the game tree. Several variations of probability-based \u03b1-\u03b2 game tree pruning are presented. We also show that probability-based \u03b1-\u03b2 pruning can be viewed as a generalization of the standard \u03b1-\u03b2 game tree search algorithm and that it inherits some good properties from its point-value version.",

         "Abstract": "It has long been an unsolved problem whether the king, bishop and knight can win against the king alone in the game of kriegspiel. In this paper, it is shown that in general (say, with king initially guarding both bishop and knight), the player with bishop and knight can win with probability one. The proof is constructive; a general procedure for winning is explicitly exhibited. In addition, it may be assumed that the player with king alone plays with full knowledge of the past moves of his opponent. The winning procedure involves randomization and so no upper bound can be placed on the number of moves required to mate. With king, bishop and knight initially on h8, g8 and h7, respectively, the expected number of moves required by the proposed winning strategy is less than 100. Whether or not there exists a strategy that guarantees mate within a fixed number of moves is still unknown.",
         "Introduction": "In this paper we deal with the long unsolved problem of whether the king, bishop and knight can win against the king alone in the game of kriegspiel. For the purpose of this paper we do not need to give the complete rules of the game. It suffices to say that kriegspiel is the game of chess in which the players are not informed of their opponent's moves. Instead, each player keeps track of the position of his own pieces and tries to gain information about the position of the opponent's pieces as the game progresses. There is a referee who controls the game by keeping track of the true position and by telling the player whose turn it is to move, whether a proposed move is a legal chess move or not, using the word \"no\" to indicate an illegal move. In addition, when a legal move puts a player's king in check, the referee announces this fact to both players and specifies the direction of the check. In our case, this essentially means that he announces whether the check is by the bishop or the knight or both."

This should be sufficient to achieve a cool billion (thousand million) nodes per second -and a theoretical rating that will give Kasparov nightmares. But it's not going to happen soon -not in this or the next year. Some sceptics think it may not even be possible in this century. Then it will probably be Gata Kamski's or Judit Polgar's problem."

         "Abstract": "When we are faced w i t h a d e cision, the ultimate consequences of our choices are often beyond our `look-ahead horizon', even if we are aided b y a fast computer, and we can usually only make educated guesses about the potential value of those intermediate consequences that are not beyond that horizon. One example of such a situation is the problem of choosing good moves in a game of chess. We develop a mathematical model that realistically describes chess and other decision problems, and use this model to investigate two questions: how to best use the information obtained b y a given look-ahead procedure, and how to organize the look-ahead procedure so as to obtain the most useful information. We show that the usual algorithm used by chess-playing computers (the Shannon algorithm) is awed because it does not take into account its own bounded rationality. We derive several meta-principles for decision making, and show that they explain some recent successful deviations from the Shannon algorithm. Several suggestions for further improvements are discussed.",
         "Introduction": "Deep Thought, a c hess playing machine that can calculate more moves ahead than all other computer programs, recently took rst place in the World Computer Chess Championships, has defeated a number of human grandmasters, and even challenged, albeit unsuccessfully, World Champion Gary Kasparov. Deep Thought's designers are working on an even more powerful micro chip with which Deep Thought will be able to calculate an additional 2 full moves ahead, giving it enough strength (so they claim) to beat Kasparov with ease, in spite of the fact that the machine's knowledge of the principles of chess is relatively primitive. Can we agree with Gary Kasparov, who still believes that sheer brute calculation cannot match h uman ingenuity?"

The Morph project will be continuing over a n umb e r o f y ears as we strive to bring its playing level up to the current brute-force chess machines. To do this the e ort will be to make the learning mechanisms and their mutual cooperation as sharp as possible.

         "Abstract": "Although both shared memory and loosely coupled parallel computing systems are now common, many still do not offer an easy way to design, implement, and test parallel algorithms. Our system provides software tools that make possible a variety of connection structures between processes. These structures are said to form a 'Network Multi-Processor', which is implemented on a local area network of heterogeneous UNIX-based timesharing computers, plus a set of processor boards dedicated to an application so that accurate timing measurements can be made. We explain how these tools have been used both to aid parallel algorithm development and to explore the properties of different computer interconnection methods.",
         "Introduction": "Parallelism may be applied in several ways to increase the processing power available to the execution of a program. These approaches can be broadly categorized into two groups: use of closely coupled or synchronized processors, and loosely coupled, distributed systems. Closely coupled systems have traditionally been more popular since they can be used directly to speed existing algorithms and programs. For example, powerful vector processors are now well established and most contemporary systems use some degree of pipelining, but have the disadvantage that applications must be specially tailored to the hardware design. Also they are only well-suited to certain classes of problems. Those systems provide what is often referred to as 'fine-grained' parallelism. This paper deals primarily with 'large-grained' parallelism."

These are 1) its search through the hypothesis space and 2) the amount of provided information for the system to work. In this paper we use a constrained relative least-general-generalisation (RLGG) algorithm as method of generaUsation to organise the search space and an automatic example generator to reduce the user's intervention and guide the learning process. Some initial results to learn a restricted form of Horn clause concepts in chess are presented. The main limitations of the learning system and the example generator are pointed out and conclusions and future research directions indicated.",

We provide the system with a description of a position where a piece is threatening another one, but we do not tell the system what concept we want to learn or which arguments are involved in the new concept."

         "Abstract": "Efficient space and time exploitation of symmetry in domains on highly parallel, distributed-memory architecture is, in certain cases, equivalent to routing along a labeled group action graph, with computation associated with each group element label, where the group of symmetries acts on the processors. The algebraic structure of the group can sometimes be analyzed to determine, a priori, space and time efficient routing schedules on the hardware network (which, in practice, is often another group action graph). The algorithms we develop were implemented on a 64K-processor CM-2 and used to solve certain natural classes of chess endgames, part of whose search space is invariant under a noncommutative crystallographic group. This program runs 400 times faster than any previous implementation, and discovered many interesting new results in the area; some of these results are not solvable in practice with current serial techniques because the time and space requirements are too large. It seems interesting that it was possible, albeit with difficulty, to implement efficiently certain irregular chess rules on the CM-2, which is optimized for regular data sets.",

Existing literature on go playing programs and applications of machine learning to games are surveyed. An error function based on a database of master games is defined which is used to formulate the learning of go as an optimization problem. A classification technique called pattern preference is presented which is able to automatically derive patterns representative of good moves; a hashing technique allows pattern preference to run efficiently on conventional hardware with graceful degradation as memory size decreases.",

         "Abstract": "An endgame database for chess encodes optimal lines of play for a speci c endgame involving a small number of pieces. The computation of such a database is feasible for as many as six pieces provided the inherent parallelism in the problem is fully exploited. Two computer architectures which can do this are the SIMD CM-2 and the vector multiprocessor YMP. F or each m a c hine the computer programs opera t e o n s e t s o f c hess positions, each position represented by a single bit. The high level algorithm is an iterative backtracking procedure. After describing endgame databases and classifying the complexity o f endgames we outline the algorithms and give some details of their implementation in fortran for parallel and vector architectures. For endgames with ve or more pieces it is important to use the symmetries of the chess board to reduce storage requirements, and we indicate brie y how this can be done for the vector architecture. Some timing comparisons are presented.",
         "Introduction": "Computers are having a signi cant impact on the game of chess. There are many computers which p l a y c hess, and some of these have e v en achieved the skill of a weak grandmaster 2]. There is software which stores games in a database which can then be used to study various openings or can be used to analyze the style of play of a future opponent 1 ]. What we will consider in this paper is the use of computers to create an endgame database 9]. In the endgame there are a small number of pieces left on the chess board, and one can imagine describing all the correct lines of play. For the chess community such databases provide unequivocally correct move sequences from any position in the database, and have b e e n u s e d t o c hallenge accepted wisdom about the outcome of various games. For the computer scientist endgames provide an interesting and open-ended computational problem -when all n-piece endgames have been solved we need only go on to consider n+1-piece games. All 5-piece endgame databases 5] and almost all pawnless 6-piece databases 4] h a ve been created, although archival storage of the latter is not available. This paper is primarily directed at an audience normally dealing with scienti c computations such as computational uid dynamics. In contrast to those problems, endgame database construction involves parallel logical op-erations on sets of bits. In the hope that it will be instructive for those doing large scale scienti c computations, we present the basic algorithms in some detail in the form of code fragments. and we discuss how these perform for smaller endgames on two supercomputers, the Connection Machine CM-2 6], and the Cray YMP8/128. The algorithm was originally devised for the Connection "

         "Abstract": "Rather than search exhaustively in large problem spaces, people use heuristics that entail minimal search and yet support intelligent decisions. Human performance in such spaces is robust and improves with experience. Game playing is a good example. The traditional AI approach to game playing, however, has been to build a program that plays only a single game, and plays it very well. Because exhaustive search of the game graph and minimax of the resultant values guarantees perfect play, programmed champions rely on deep, fast, efficient search. Despite their more limited, fallible memories and arguably slower processors, human masters often defeat a program whose search is incomplete. People search less, remember less, and somehow make the right choices. This paper describes HOYLE, a program that learns to play specific games under the direction of a weak theory, clearly delineated prior knowledge about games in general. HOYLE differs from most game-playing programs in two ways: it is able to play any of a broad class of games according to the rules, and it improves its performance through a variety of learning paradigms. HOYLE shows that, for a class of related problems, it is possible to replace deep search with a weak theory based upon heuristically selective cache memories and a consensus about action among reliable rationales.",
         "Introduction": "The thesis of the work described here is that human expert decisions are based on more than search, that they rely on a synergy between intelligent rationales for decision making and limited recollection of significant experience. The human expert has what we describe here as a weak theory, prior general knowledge about a broad domain that includes ways to represent and apply information about it, heuristics for preferring and avoiding alternatives in it, and reasons to remember certain kinds of information. The expert's weak theory, we believe, supports the acquisition and application of detailed information to control search for specific problems."

Pattern-recognition theory explains expertise through the existence of many small, unrelated knowledge units. Recent research stresses the structure of knowledge representations. However, the standard paradigm does not allow for the detection of relations between chunks; the theoretical shift has to be accompanied by a methodological shift. In Experiment 1, by means of a partitioning task, evidence was provided for a hierarchical representation of chess positions. Chess masters formed larger and more complex knowledge units than average players. In Experiment 2, the typicality of the positions was varied. The more typical the positions were, the larger and more coherent the constructed knowledge units were. The greatest differences between both groups occurred in more typical positions. This reflects the experts' ability to relate several knowledge units with one another.",

The first group had to solve chess problems with objective solutions and received veridical feedback; each member of the second group faced problems with no objective solutions, and received the same feedback as the member of the first group he was yoked with, but without any control on it; the control group received a waiting task. It was found at the end of the experiment that the group with unsolvable problems was more depressed than the two other groups. The mid-strength players were the most sensitive to the manipulation, and the weakest players showed little effect of learned helplessness. It was also found that the effects were proportional to the degree of similarity between the treatment and the posttest. The results limit the domain of applicability of the learned-helplessness model.",
         "Introduction": "Research on learned helplessness in humans has investigated the effect of noncontingency on performance. Although the nature of this effect has not yet been clearly stated, several studies have identified variables that might influence performance within the learned-helplessness context, such as the importance of task "

         "Abstract": "We propose --evaluation functions that can be used in gameplaying programs as a substitute for the traditional static evaluation functions without loss of functionality. The main advantage of an --evaluation function is that it can be implemented with a much lower time complexity than the traditional counterpart and so provides a signi cant speedup for the evaluation of any game position which e v entually results in better play. W e describe an implementation of the --evaluation function using a modi cation of the classical classi cation and regression trees and show that a typical call to this function involves the computation of only a small subset of all features that may be used to describe a game position. We show t h a t a n i t e rative bootstrap process can be used to learn --evaluation functions e ciently and describe some of the experience we made with this new approach applied to a game called malawi.",
         "Introduction": "Game playing programs especially those for two-person games with complete information and with alternating moves like c hess and checkers make u p a very important part of AI research 2, 11, 1, 4]. Programs for interesting, i.e. non-trivial games are both search-intensive and knowledge-intensive systems where the complexity of search can be traded o for complexity o f k n o wledge and vice versa, because one can try to explore all possible paths of play from a given position towards the end of a game where the outcome is evident o r one can try to nd out some information about the values of next positions in a knowledge base. In practice, the search depth of the dynamic search i n the game tree has to be restricted somehow and a heuristic static evaluation function is applied to the positions at the horizon of search from where they are backed up to the next positions."

         "Abstract": "The paper reviews the evidence for and against the recognition-association theory and a forward-search (SEEK) theory of chess skill. The recognition-association theory appears to be founded on indirect evidence concerning visual short-term memory, together with supplementary assumptions that may be questioned, and provides no role for verbal processes. There is no direct support for the theory, which omits forward search for reasons that are reexamined. In contrast, the SEEK theory maintains that move choice is based on search and evaluation processes supplemented (or else supplanted) by a knowledge base. These processes are directly evidenced by experimental findings. The objection that search theories cannot account for speed chess is met by a review of the available evidence. It is concluded that chess skill relies on thinking ahead rather than on pattern recognition.",

         "Abstract": "Three studies of calibration are reported. Calibration refers to the accuracy with which one can predict one's own performance. In the first study child chess players, non-chess playing parents, and statistics students were asked to predict chances of winning chess games against hypothetical opponents. These subjective probabilities were compared to the actual probabilities, based on the Elo rating system. Better players' predictions were better calibrated. Confidence and ratings are negatively correlated, indicating that with lower ratings, players are overconfident. Skilled child players' predictions were better calibrated than any of the adults'. In the second study subjects were asked to estimate chances of winning in conjunctive situations, e.g., winning all the rounds in a tournament. Again, better child players were more accurate in their predictions and more accurate than adults. In the third study, child players were asked to predict their chances of winning in a non-chess domain after hearing a hypothetical win/loss history. Higher-rated players' predictions were again better calibrated, even though the domain was outside their expertise. The motivational and cognitive implications of calibration are discussed.",
         "Introduction": "Amid the vast literature on poor decision-making and the limits of rationality, research on chess cognition stands out as a prime example of the excellence of human judgment. It is difficult to believe that 12-and 13-year-olds become chess masters and that children as young as 6 and 7 compete against adult players and earn quite respectable chess ratings. At first blush, one is tempted to label these children \"idiot savants\" with some special, and exceedingly rare, chess talent. But there are simply too many competent child players -even in the United States where chess players of any ilk are rare. Models of chess skill must be able to account for high levels of competence among chil-dren. Also, understanding how children acquire their skill may have important practical implications for the enhancement of other types of learning."

While this question has received some attention in the context of two-player perfect-information games, it is also considered for single-agent problem solving. Primarily, however, we focus on the reason that makes minimaxing this useful in game-playing practice (especially in computer chess). A class of models based on domainindependent definitions of quiescence is investigated, observing more and more realistic behavior with more and more realistic definitions. As a global result these models show beneficial behavior based on the specific properties of the tree and especially without the need for improvements of the evaluation function toward the end of the game or even error-free evaluations. In contrast, the model investigated for single-agent problem solving needs improved accuracy of the static values with increasing depth for making look-ahead beneficial."

The five round Swiss-style tournament was held in Albuquerque, New Mexico at the Doubletree Hotel. Twelve teams participated with all but two teams playing clearly at the level of chess masters. Finishing in second place with a 4-1 score was M CHESS, which received the award for best small computer; while CRAY BLITZ and MEPHISTO tied for third place with 3-2 scores. $8,000 in prizes were distributed with $4,000 going to the winner.",
         "Introduction": "DEEP THOUGHT II ran on an IBM RS/6000 550 processor connected to 24 specially designed VLSI chess processors. The IBM programming team of Feng-hsiung Hsu and Murray Campbell had used only two processors last year when DEEP THOUGHT/88 managed to tie for first place, but this year, with an additional year of software improvements and much improved hardware, their program clearly dominated the competition. It was carrying out brute-force searches on most moves to a depth of ten levels (five moves for each side) and deeper along tactical lines. During endgame play, it searched even deeper. On average, DEEP THOUGHT II examined 5,000,000 chess positions per second. With moves made at an average rate of 180 seconds per move, 900,000,000 chess positions were searched by the program when making a move."

Questo non toglie che a prima vista i luoghi comuni circa l'assenza di questo fattore dagli scacchi siano attendibili. Per affrontare I'argomento occorre anzitutto sovrapporre al concetto vago di \"fortuna\" del senso comune un concetto rigorosamente definito: sar\u00e0, se lo si far\u00e0 con giovani scacchisti o aspiranti matematici, una delle tante occasioni per mostrare che uno dei vantaggi della matematica \u00e8 proprio quello di fornire strumenti per sovrapporre ai concetti del senso comune concetti rigorosamente definiti. Supponiamo, si dir\u00e0, di essere in una situazione cui possono seguirne altre: s1,s2,....,sn, di probabilit\u00e0 rispettive p1, p2,...,pn; si chiama allora \"speranza\" o \"utilit\u00e0 la somma u=p1 v1+P2 v2+...+Pn vn. Supponiamo ora che di fatto si verifichi una situazione, fra quelle elencate come possibili, di valore v; sembra abbastanza aderente al senso comune chiamare fortuna (del protagonista, in quella circostanza) la differenza v -u e, se vogliamo, sfortuna il suo opposto u -v. Se si vuole che questa teoria risulti applicabile conviene che le probabilit\u00e0 e i valori siano presi in un opportuno campo non archimedeo, che il valore 0 sia riservato agli eventi impossibili e il valore 1 agli aventi D certi. Tornando agli scacchi occorre anzitutto chiarire che il gioco \u00e8 determinato, nel senso che si verifica una (e una sola) delle seguenti possibilit\u00e0: a) Esiste una strategia vincente per il Bianco; b) Esiste una strategia vincente per il Nero; c) Esistono due strategie di patta, una per il Bianco e una per il Nero."

As is well-known, von Kempelen's machine and the others were conjurer's tricks and grand hoaxes. In contrast, around 1890 a Spanish engineer, Torres y Quevedo, designed a true mechanical player for KR vs K (king and rook against king) endgames (Bell 1978). A later version of that machine was displayed at the Paris Exhibition of 1914 and now resides in a museum at Madrid's Polytechnic University. Despite the success of this electro-mechanical device, further advances on chess automata did not come until the 1940s. During that decade there was a sudden spurt of activity as several leading engineers and mathematicians, intrigued by the power of computers, began to express their ideas about computer chess. Some, like Tihamer Nemes (1951) and Konrad Zuse (1945) tried a hardware approach, but their computer-chess works did not find wide acceptance. Others, like noted scientist Alan Turing, found success with a more philosophical tone, stressing the importance of the stored program concept ",

         "Introduction": "The board game go is one of the grand challenges of game related artificial intelligence. While go is a finite, perfect information game, its game tree is prohibitively large for tree searches. The situation in go is perhaps best compared with that in chess, which has been called \"the drosophila of artificial intelligence\", meaning that a multitude of key problems of artificial intelligence appear in chess and can be studied there. Currently, the best chess playing programs rely heavily on large scale tree searches and use a comparatively small amount of chess knowledge. In go it is the other way round, i.e. the quality of the go knowledge is the determining factor. Due to the structure of go, strong go programs emphasize much more the human way of thinking about go rather than brute force methods for which computers are ideal, and from this point of view one could argue that go is a much more interesting problem than chess. Many important advances have been made in go regarding the application of rule based knowledge representations, pattern recognition and machine learning. For a recent, lucid review of computer go see "

         "Abstract": "Because we think that plans or strategies are useful for coordinating multiple agents, and because we hypothesize that most of the plans we use are build partly by us and partly by our immediate environment (which includes other agents), this paper is devoted to the conditions in which strategies can be viewed as the result of interactions between simple agents, each of them having only local information about the state of the world. Our approach is based on the study of some examples of reactive agents applications. Their features arebriefly described and we underline, in each of them, what we call the emergent strategies obtained from the local interactions between the agents. Three examples are studied this way: the eco-problem-solving implementations of Pengi and the N-Puzzle, and the sociogenesis process occuring in the artificial ant colonies that compose the MANTA project. We then consider a typical strategical game (chess), and see how to decompose it through a distributed reactive approach called MARCH. Some characteristics of the game are analysed and we conclude on the necessity to handle both a global strategy and local tactics in order to obtain a decently strong chess program.",
         "Introduction": "In military science as well as in everyday life, building a strategy usually means making a plan of coordinated actions for reaching a particular goal. It often refers to situations in which (1) the goal to reach is possibly conflicting with the goal of another agent and (2) different resources must be employed, sometimes concurrently, in order to reach it. A strategy always relies on two strong assumptions: having a view as global as possible of the current situation, and making sure that the resources will perform the desired actions. That is why military have always payed a great attention to develop intelligence services, in order to obtain as much information as they can, and to establish strong hierarchies, in order to be obeyed on the battlefield. But that is also why famous battles have been lost. The best example could be that of the battle of Waterloo, during which the late arrival of Grouchy, due to both a lack of information and a misunderstanding of orders, has ruined the whole strategy established by Napoleon and its generals. In that respect, the disadvantages of a long term strategy are quite clear (note that these critics can be applied to plans, in the AI acceptation of the term, see "

These static schemes are simple and effective, but dynamic methods like Feldmann's \"young brothers wait\", Hyatt's Dynamic Tree Splitting, and Schaeffer's Distributed Search, though more complex, are even better. In two-person game trees some splitting methods assume that the minimal game tree is being traversed, and so split at the expected ALL nodes (well defined nodes where all successors must be examined). In the search of typical game trees, these ALL nodes are not so easily found.",

         "Abstract": "Model-based user interface design is centered around a description of application objects and operations at a level of abstraction higher than that of code. A good model can be used to support multiple interfaces, help separate interface and application, describe input sequencing in a simple way, check consistency and completeness of the interface, evaluate the interface's speed-of-use, generate context-specific help and assist in designing the interface. However, designers rarely use computer-supported application modelling today and prefer less formal approaches such as story boards of user interface prototypes. One reason is that available tools often use cryptic languages for the model specification. Another reason is that these tools force the designers to specify the application model before they can start working on the visual interface, which is their main area of expertise. We present the Interactive User Interface Design Environment (Interactive UIDE), a novel framework for concurrent development of the application model and the user interface which combines story-boarding and model-based interface design. We also present Albert, an intelligent component within this framework, which is able to infer an application model from a user interface and from an interview process with the designer.",
         "Introduction": "The paper first discusses the design methodology, application model and usage modes of Interactive UIDE. It then explains the use, architecture and capabilities of Albert."

The analysis of these approaches shows several of the bene ts the use of qualitative knowledge can bring to Machine Learning and also points out important problems that have to be dealt with. The need for qualitative knowledge to keep learning tractable is illustrated with examples from the domain of chess. Finally we m a k e some suggestions for further research based on the shortcomings of previous approaches.",

The research reported in this paper is aimed at investigating knowledgebased chess in the context of building a prototype chess tutor, UMRAO, which helps students learn how to play bishop-pawn endgames. In tutoring it is essential to take a knowledge-based approach, since students must learn how to manipulate strategic concepts, not how to carry out large-scale lookahead searches.",

With considerable success, researchers have been trying to create computer chess programs to equal or surpass the best human chess players. Most of these programs are based on the idea of carrying out massive amounts of search through a huge tree of potential moves and counter-moves.

Chief Arbiter Joel Salman conducted the drawing of lots using numbered, colored diskettes. International Masters Maurice Ashley and Danny Kopec provided commentary during and between the rounds. Play proceeded throughout the morning and afternoon with no significant incidents. There was considerable media coverage of the event, including a segment on an ABC News Nightline episode devoted entirely to chess. Several hundred spectators watched the games on demonstration boards (often looking at the clocks as well), tried two of the programs (Kasparov's Gambit and BattleChess 4000 SVGA) on demonstration machines provided by the IBM PC Company, and toured The Computer Museum, the only museum of its kind in the world."

Almost all of these positions are unoriginal and were obtained by scanning in diagrams from chessbooks with an optical scanner. Gnuchess 4.0, at one minute per move on a 50 MHz MIPS R4000, scores 16-71% on our test les. We describe the software we wrote to accomplish the scanning task. If you take the test, please send us",
         "Introduction": "The computer chess community has long had a need for a comprehensive test suite of chess positions for the purposes of debugging and evaluating chess playing programs. Such a suite can also be useful (if it is comprehensive enough) for nding out what areas of play one's program is weak in, so that one may then improve the program in those areas. A third use of test suites was apparently invented by the authors (D. Dailey and L. Kau man) of the program \\Socrates II\" which recently won the 23rd ACM computer chess championship. This is to take a set of test positions which y ou know y our program is capable of solving (a subset of our set might be used) and to then postulate that the strength, in rating points, of your program is a monotonic function of the runtime it requires to solve the problems in this set. One then tunes the program's selective search heuristics to reduce this runtime."

We describe interconnection networks for parallel computers, tools for their efficient use (mapping, load balancing) and the parallelization of a problem which is hard to parallelize (chess programming).",
         "Introduction": "Over the last years parallel computing has received considerable attention of researchers in science and engineering. Among others, the main reasons for the growing interest are the difficulties to increase the performance of sequential computers due to tedmical and physical limitations. Furthermore, the availability of cheap mass fabricated microprocessors and communication switches makes it more economical to connect hundreds and thousands of these components than to build highly specialized sequential computers. Theoretically, such a collection of processors working in parallel can achieve unbounded performance and is therefore suitable to solve problems of all areas of science and engineering. Among these are, for example, eomputationally intensive problems like weather forecasting and computational fluid dynamics or real time problems like vision and speech recognition. A number of different architectures for the construction of parallel computers have been proposed. Flynn "

The l)rogram takes as input the rules of a specific game and analyses those rules to construct for that game an efficient representation and an evaluation function, both for use with a generic search engine. The strategic analysis performed by the program relates a set of general knowledge sources to the details of the particular game. Among other properties, this analysis determines the relative value of the differeat pieces in a given game. Although METACAMER does not learn from experience, the values resulting from its analysis are qualitatively similm-to values used by experts on known games, and are suff~cient to produce competitive performance the first time the program actually plays each game it is given. This appears to be tim first program to have de-. rived useful piece values directly from analysis of the rules of different games.",
         "Introduction": "The Problem Virtually all past research in computer game-, playing has attempted to develop computer programs which could play existing games at a reasonable standard. While some researchers consider the development of a game-specific expert for some gmne to be a sufficient end in itself, many scientists in AI are motivated by a desire for generality. Their emphasis is not on achieving strong performance on a particular game, but rather on understanding the general ability to produce such strength on a wider variety of games (or problems in general). Hence additional evaluation criteria are typically placed on the playing programs beyond mere performance in competition: criteria intended to ensure that methods used to achieve strength on a specific \"Parts of this work have been supported by RIACS, NASA Ames Research Center "

This paper shows how application of standard techniques in logic-programming (abstract interpretation and partial evaluation) makes it possible to achieve both of these goals. Using these techniques, we can represent the semantics of a large class of games in a general and declarative way, but then have the program transform this representation into a more efficient version once it is presented with the rules of a new game. This process can be viewed as moving some of the responsibility for game analysis (that concerned with efficiency) from the researcher to the program itself.",

         "Introduction": "Of the brute-force searches, depth-rst iterative-deepening DFID is the most practical, because it combines breadth-rst optimality with the low space complexity of depth-rst search. Its basic idea is as simple as conducting a series of independent depth-rst searches, each with the look-ahead horizon extended by an additional tree level. With the iterative approach, DFID is guaranteed to nd the shortest solution path, just as a breadth-rst search w ould. But in contrast to the latter, DFID needs negligible memory space. Its space complexity grows only linearly with the search depth."

         "Abstract": "In August 1992, the World Checkers Champion, Dr. Marion Tinsley, defended his title against the computer program Chinook. The best-of-40-game match was won by Tinsley with 4 wins to the program's 2. This was the first time in history that a program played for a human World Championship. Chinook, with its deep search and endgame databases, has established itself as a Grandmaster checker player. However, the match demonstrated that current brute-force game-playing techniques alone will be insufficient to defeat human champions in games as complex as checkers. This paper re-examines brute-force search and uses anecdotal evidence to argue that there comes a point where additional search is not cost effective. This limit, which we believe we are close to in checkers, becomes an obstacle to further progress. The problems of deep brute-force search described in this paper must be addressed before computers will be dominant in games such as checkers and chess.",
         "Introduction": "For over three decades, optimists have confidently predicted that the World Chess Champion will be dethroned by a computer \"within a few years\". This longsought-after event has proved remarkably elusive. Computer wins against master-level players are now commonplace, but wins against Grandmasters are still infrequent. The authors of computer-chess programs concentrate their efforts on traditional methods for improving program performance (faster search and better heuristics). To this point, doubling the speed of the hardware and/or software has translated linearly into better play. If this trend continued indefinitely, then the milestone of a computer World Chess Champion should be only a few years away. However, is there a limit beyond which increased search effort will result in diminished performance gains?"

The lack of knowledge about the opponents' possible moves gives the game tree a very large branching factor, making the tree so immense that game-tree searching is infeasible. In this paper, we describe our approach for overcoming this problem. We develop a model of imperfect-information games, and describe how to represent information about the game using a modi ed version of a task network that is extended to represent multi-agency and uncertainty. We present a game-playing procedure that uses this approach to generate game trees in which the set of alternative choices is determined not by the set of possible actions, but by the set of available tactical and strategic schemes. In our tests of this approach on the game of bridge, we found that it generated trees having a much smaller branching factor than would have been generated by conventional game-tree search techniques. Thus, even in the worst case, the game tree contained only about 1300 nodes, as opposed to the approximately 6:01 10 44 nodes that would have been produced by a brute-force game tree search in the worst case. Furthermore, our approach successfully solved typical bridge problems that matched situations in its knowledge base. These preliminary tests suggest that our approach has the potential to yield bridge-playing programs much better than existing ones|and thus we have begun to build a full implementation.",

It relies on the formalization of search heuristics of high-skilled human experts which have resulted in the development of successful applications in different areas.

For small-dimensional \"toy\" problems a solution can be obtained; however, for most real-world problems the dimension increases and the number of variations increases significantly, sometimes exponentially, as a function of dimension "

The computation of such a database is feasible for as many as six pieces provided the inherent parallelism in the problem is fully exploited. Two computer architectures which can do this are the SIMD CM-2 and the vector multiprocessor YMP. F or each m a c hine the computer programs opera t e o n s e t s o f c hess positions, each position represented by a single bit. The high level algorithm is an iterative backtracking procedure. After describing endgame databases and classifying the complexity o f endgames we outline the algorithms and give some details of their implementation in fortran for parallel and vector architectures. For endgames with ve or more pieces it is important to use the symmetries of the chess board to reduce storage requirements, and we indicate brie y how this can be done for the vector architecture. Some timing comparisons are presented.",
         "Introduction": "Computers are having a signi cant impact on the game of chess. There are many computers which p l a y c hess, and some of these have e v en achieved the skill of a weak grandmaster 2]. There is software which stores games in a database which can then be used to study various openings or can be used to analyze the style of play of a future opponent 1 ]. What we will consider in this paper is the use of computers to create an endgame database 9]. In the endgame there are a small number of pieces left on the chess board, and one can imagine describing all the correct lines of play. For the chess community such databases provide unequivocally correct move sequences from any position in the database, and have b e e n u s e d t o c hallenge accepted wisdom about the outcome of various games. For the computer scientist endgames provide an interesting and open-ended computational problem -when all n-piece endgames have been solved we need only go on to consider n+1-piece games. All 5-piece endgame databases 5] and almost all pawnless 6-piece databases 4] h a ve been created, although archival storage of the latter is not available. This paper is primarily directed at an audience normally dealing with scienti c computations such as computational uid dynamics. In contrast to those problems, endgame database construction involves parallel logical op-erations on sets of bits. In the hope that it will be instructive for those doing large scale scienti c computations, we present the basic algorithms in some detail in the form of code fragments. and we discuss how these perform for smaller endgames on two supercomputers, the Connection Machine CM-2 6], and the Cray YMP8/128. The algorithm was originally devised for the Connection "

         "Introduction": "This book is a sign of its times. Each one of the chapters -papers written by European authors of various backgrounds -illustrates a departure from the style of theorizing that has been prominent in the social sciences for most of the century. Until very recently, models for behavioral phenomena were chiefly based on numerical representations of the objects of concern, e.g. the subjects and the stimuli under study. This was due in large part to the influence of nineteenth century physics, which played the role of the successful older sister, the one that had to be imitated if one wished to be taken seriously in scientific circles. The mystical belief that there could be science only when the objects of concern were susceptible of measurement in the sense of physics was a credo that could not be violated without risks. Another, more honorable justification was that the numerical models were the only ones capable of feasible calculations. (In fact, these models were typically linear.) An early example of such theorizing in psychology is factor analysis, which attempted to represent the results of mental tests in a real vector space of small dimensionality, each subject being represented by a point in that space. A dimension was interpreted as a scale measuring some mental ability. The analysis was simple, and only required an electrical desk calculator (with spinning wheels), and a suitable amount of determination. Psychometric models and practices, which are currently the object of much criticisms, are in the same vein."

         "Abstract": "The point of game tree search is to insulate oneself from errors in the evaluation function. The standard approach is to grow a full width tree as deep as time allows, and then value the tree as if the leaf evaluations were exact. This has been effective in many games because of the computational efficiency of the alpha-beta algorithm. A Bayesian would suggest instead to train a model of one's uncertainty. This model adds extra information in addition to the standard evaluation function. Within such a formal model, there is an optimal tree growth procedure and an optimal method of valueing the tree. We describe how to optimally value the tree, and how to approximate on line the optimal tree to search. Our tree growth procedure provably approximates the contribution of each leaf to the utility in the limit where we grow a large tree, taking explicit account of the interactions between expanding different leaves. That is to say, our procedure estimates the relevance of each leaf and iteratively expands the most relevant leaves. Our algorithms run (under reasonable assumptions) in linear time and hence except for a small constant factor, are as efficient as alphabeta.",

         "Abstract": "This paper provides a novel Chinese Chess model which is based on rule-based system and fuzzy cognitive map for reasoning a best legal move. A 10 x 9 guard matrix is generated by FCM t o show the status of each intersection. Each entry in the matrix is called a guard value which indicates how an intersection is guarded by the player's side or attacked by the opponent's. We also reason the best next move with 36 rules by the membership functions of guard values. Based on the proposed model, not only the legitimacy of the next move can be improved but also the decision time is much shorter than the game tree searching method of alpha-beta model. An example is given t o verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Also, a multi-step decision method is presented to double check the legitimacy of this work. .",

         "Abstract": "We have built a distributed chess program running over a network of workstations. The program consists of several independent \"advising\" processes each using different chess knowledge to evaluate the position; each evaluator offers its advice to a coordinating process, which uses a selection policy to choose the move. We have built the advisors redistributing the knowledge included in a strong sequential program. We have made experiments with several different knowledge distributions and move selection policies. Some programs we built are sensibly stronger than the sequential program from which we started using seven workstations only.",
         "Introduction": "Modern networked systems make available more and more computing power at cheaper prices, and this encourages the development of CPU-bound distributed AI programs which exploit the new hardware. Chess-playing programs are certainly CPU-bound, but they are also difficult to parallelize. In fact, to build a strong parallel chess program is much more difficult than building a strong sequential chess program, because there are many special problems introduced by parallelism: most heuristics developed to improve the performance of parallel alphabeta do not scale well to parallel implementations "

It requires great computing power, thus parallel hardware is an obvious candidate to strenghten playing programs. In this paper we compare a number of search algorithms for game tree search in the domain of chess. The algorithms have been embedded in the same program running on a network of workstations. We classify and survey a number of search algorithms. The algorithms have been classified in two main classes: static and dynamic. In order to make a practical comparison, we have used a standard set of chess positions. We show that on a network static algorithms are more efficient than dynamic ones: our results confirm and broaden older works by Marsland, Campbell, Schaeffer, and others.",
         "Introduction": "The alphabeta algorithm is the basis of most playing programs that search game trees. Its efficiency is decisive in programs based on brute-force search. For instance, some experiments found that improving five times the running time of the alphabeta algorithm the playing strength of a chess program improves about 200 Elo points "

         "Abstract": "Counter to the common belief that expert performance reflects innate abilities and capacities, recent research in different domains of expertise has shown that expert performance is predominantly mediated by acquired complex skills and physiological adaptations. For elite performers, supervised practice starts at very young ages and is maintained at high daily levels for more than a decade. The effects of extended deliberate practice are more far-reaching than is commonly believed. Performers can acquire skills that circumvent basic limits on working memory capacity and sequential processing. Deliberate practice can also lead to anatomical changes resulting from adaptations to intense physical activity. The study of expert performance has important implications for our understanding of the structure and limits of human adaptation and optimal learning.",
         "Introduction": "The reasons for the lack of impact become clear when we consider the two most dominant approaches and their respective goals. The human information-processing approach, or the skills approach, has attempted to explain exceptional performance in terms of knowledge and skills acquired through experience.

Several mechanisms are investigated to cope with these overheads in order to achieve a high performance. We study a combination of local, medium range, and global load distribution strategies that does not only show a good behavior in terms of work load, but also has a positive in uence on the search o verhead. The e cient u s e of a virtual shared memory, that is distributed among the processors, shows also a big contribution to the overall performance of the system. A carefully restricted application of parallelism using an improved version of the Young Brothers Wait Concept (YBWC) leads to a perfect behavior for minimal Min/Max trees and to a quite low search o verhead, if well ordered trees are searched. Well ordered trees constitute the most important case in practice, since a couple of move ordering mechanisms are known that achieve a nearly optimal move ordering in many applications. The resulting combination of the methods shows an eciency better than any previous approach. Experiments carried out using 256 DeBruijn-connected Transputers result in a speedup of 142 even applying restricted timing constraints. With a system consisting of 1024 grid connected Transputers we obtain a speedup of 344. Moreover the algorithm shows a very good scalability, especially using interconnection networks with logarithmic diameter. The experiments have been carried out using a Min/Max search program that incorporates all important state-of-theart search techniques (Zugzwang, current v i c e w orld champion in computer chess) and therefore makes sure, that no arti cial or simplifying assumptions on the structure of the problem are made.",
         "Introduction": "Tree search algorithms play an important role in many applications in the eld of arti cial intelligence. In this paper we study the overheads arising in our distributed Min/Max tree evaluation algorithm. Our algorithm runs e ciently even on massively parallel systems."

To investigate the programming issues, we engineered a parallel chess program called *Socrates, which running on the NCSA's 512 processor CM-5, tied for third in the 1994 ACM International Computer Chess Championship. *Socrates uses the Jamboree algorithm to search game trees in parallel and uses the Cilk 1.0 language and run-time system to express and to schedule the computation. In order to obtain good performance for chess, we use several mechanisms not directly provided by Cilk, such as aborting computations and directly accessing the active message layer to implement a global transposition table distributed across the processors.",
         "Introduction": "Computer chess provides a good testbed for understanding dynamic MIMD-style computations. The parallelism in computer chess is derived from a dynamic expansion of a highly irregular game-tree, which makes computer chess difficult to express, for example, as a data-parallel program. To investigate how to program this sort of dynamic MIMD-style application, we engineered a parallel chess program called *Socrates (pronounced \"Star-Socrates\".) The program, based on Heuristic Software's serial Socrates program, has an informally estimated rating of over 2400 USCF. *Socrates, running on the 512node CM-5 at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois, tied for third place in the 1994 ACM International Computer Chess Championship held at the end of June 1994 in Cape May, New Jersey."

         "Introduction": "This paper describes an architecture for emulation of those portions of the higher-echelon command and control task which involving planning and evaluation of courses of action (COA). The architecture utilizes the technique of tree lookahead with game theory. Tree lookahead is a technique for computing optimal decisions. It is native to game theory where it serves as a tool for both theory and practice. In chess it is now the preferred method in real time. It is precisely the chess application which motivates its adoption into an overall command and control architecture. Chess is the prototypical war game and the ways that chess players develop their strategies are not unlike the techniques used by commanders to reason about and plan the course of action to pursue in a combat situation."

         "Abstract": "Chess endgame databases, while of important theoretical interest, have yet to make a significant impact in tournament chess. In the game of checkers, however, endgame databases have played a pivotal role in the success of our World Championship challenger program Chinook. Consequently, we are interested in building databases consisting of hundreds of billions of positions. Since database positions arise frequently in Chinook's search trees, the databases must be accessible in real-time, unlike in chess. This paper discusses techniques for building large endgame databases using a network of workstations, and how this data can be organized for use in a real-time search. Although checkers is used to illustrate many of the ideas, the techniques and tools developed are also applicable to chess.",
         "Introduction": "In computer chess, the impact of precomputed endgame databases on tournament play has been relatively small. There are primarily three reasons for this. First, the variety of chess pieces result in different classes of endgames, many of which are rarely seen in actual play. Second, the outcome of most chess games is usually decided well before the endgame, meaning that even if databases were available, they would rarely play a role in determining a game's outcome. Consequently, few chess programs use non-trivial databases as part of their real-time search. Third, the substantial computational resources required to build endgame databases in the conventional way "

The algorithm gathers information to determine how likely it is that the search of a sub-tree will produce a useful result. \"Likeliness\" is measured by the conspiracy numbers, the minimum number of leaf nodes that must change their value (by being searched deeper) to cause the minimax value of a sub-tree to change. The search is controlled by the conspiracy threshold (CT), the minimum number of conspirators beyond which it is considered unlikely that a sub-tree's value can be changed.",

         "Introduction": "Logically, chess is a trivial game: at every move, simply follow through each possible reply and its consequences until either a mate or a draw position is reached. In practical terms, however, this strategy is not workable, since an astronomically large number of chess positions would have to be examined. Thus both human players and computers rely on simplification to build an approximate model of the game. Human players have centuries of tradition and at least two hundred years of chess literature to draw on in building their personal model, but computer chess is less than fifty years old. Significant among the early ideas in computer chess is Claude Shannon's 1949-50 distinction between a brute force (type-A) strategy for looking at every combination of moves, and the use of chess knowledge to select and examine only a subset of the available moves (type-B strategy). Although some electromechanical systems to play a subset of chess had been built prior to Shannon's work, it was the programming of his ideas that led to the development of today's computer chess machines."

Because of complexity it was not possible to deal with the game of chess as a whole, but only with a small endgame. Results and open questions are discussed.",
         "Introduction": "Neural networks may be applied well in a lot of practical areas, such as visual pattern recognition, voice recognition or voice synthesis. So far only a few work has been done to use neural networks in game playing, e. g. backgammon and bridge (see [TESAURO/SEJNOWSKI 891, [KOHLE/SCHONBAUER 891). In the authors' opinion, so far no efforts have been made in the game of chess. The game of chess as a whole is actually too complex for training a neural network. So we selected only a small endgame where complete knowledge is available. The aim of this project was to transform this complete information (of a small subfield from the game of chess) into a neural network. Chapter 2 describes the chess endgame white Queen against black King (with certain additional conditions). From this we obtain the input and output data for training the network. In chapter 3 the structure of the network is explained. Chapter 4 gives experimental results using a neural network simulator and discusses the experiments."

         "Introduction": "OF the brute-force searches, depth-rst iterative-deepening DFID is the most practical, because it combines breadthrst optimality with the low space complexity of depthrst search. Its basic idea is as simple as conducting a series of independent depth-rst backtracking searches, each with the look-ahead horizon extended by an additional tree level. With the iterative approach, DFID is guaranteed to nd the shortest solution path, just as a breadth-rst search w ould. But in contrast to the latter, DFID needs negligible memory space. Its space complexity grows only linearly with the search depth."

The fast execution time is attributed to the recursive nature of our algorithms and to their e cient data structure a simple array for storing the best-rst node information. In practical applications with more expensive leaf evaluations we conjecture that the recursive state space search algorithms perform even better and might e v entually supersede the popular directional search methods.",

A compiler for a Very High Level Language, designed for a specific application domain, has more knowledge about its application domain and may use this knowledge to generate efficient parallel code without requiring the programmer to deal with explicit parallelism. To investigate this idea, we designed Multigame, a Very High Level Language for describing board games. A Multigame program is a formal description of the rules of a game, from which the Multigame compiler automatically generates a parallel game playing program.",
         "Introduction": "Parallelism in general-purpose languages can be either explicit or implicit. Explicit parallelism requires the programmer to explicitly point out in a program where the parallelism is, and deal with issues like communication, synchronization, deadlock prevention and data-and workload distribution. This is hard to do correctly and places a burden upon the programmer."

The three experiments provided data indicating that problem subspace abstraction has both benefits and costs. Active representation blockades alternative representations unless subjects restructure. As a result, chess players often make serious cognitive errors by abstracting the wrong problem subspaces. Even in strategical positions, the problem subspaces generated are selfconsistent and bound by unconscious content-specific principles.",

Identifying and characterizing users' chunks can help in gauging the users' level of expertise. The algorithm described in this paper works with information collected by an automatic logging mechanism. Therefore, it is applicable to situations in which no human intervention is required to perform the analysis, such as adaptive interfaces. An empirical study was conducted to validate the algorithm, showing that mental chunks and their characteristics can indeed be inferred from an analysis of human-computer interaction logs. Users performing a variety of goal-directed tasks were monitored. Using an automated logging tool, every command invoked, every operation performed with the input devices, as well as all system responses were recorded. Analysis of the interaction logs was performed by a program that implements a chunk detection algorithm that looks at comm'and sequences and timings. The results support the hypothesis that a significant number of user mental chunks can be detected by our algorithm.",
         "Introduction": "Users of computers vary widely in knowledge, skill, and abilities. Additionally, any individual user's skill and abilities vary over time, as users learn through practice and experience. User diversity and variability have been the object of many studies, classifying users into categories corresponding to levels of expertise. Through our work, we show how an automatic identification of computer user skill can be achieved through chunk identification."

First, an example of a chess playing computer carrying 'emergent' content is offered from Dennett. Next I examine Cummins' response to this example. Cummins says Dennett's computer executes a rule which is inexplicitly represented. Cummins describes a process wherein a computer interprets explicit rules in its program, implements them to form a chess-playing device, then this device executes the rules in a way that exhibits them inexplicitly. Though this approach is intriguing, I argue that the chess-playing device cannot exist as imagined. The processes of interpretation and implementation produce explicit representations of the content claimed to be inexplicit. Finally, the Chinese Room argument is examined and shown not to save the notion of inexplicit information. This means the strategy of attributing inexplicit content to a computer which is executing a rule, fails.",
         "Introduction": "Is it possible for representational content that is relevant to the explanation of a cemputer's behavior to be carried by the computer without explicit internal representation of that content? In this paper I will examine some answers to this question. One answer is to hold that the content is an emergent property of the system. It is content that is convenient for describing behavior of the system, but the content plays no causal role for the system. This is the view of Daniel Dennett. Another, more interesting answer is that the content is somehow carried and used by the system in a way relevant to its performance, but that there is no representational state in the system which can be singled out as carrying that content. Since there is not state carrying the content, the content is said to be carried by the computer inexplicitly. This is an intriguing view defended recently by Robert "

         "Abstract": "Chess can be considered as a complex system of arithmetic constraints. There exist both geometric constraints (relationships of pieces on the board) and time constraints (number and order of moves within several variations) in chess.",
         "Introduction": "In the past, the game of chess has served as a useful test-bed for the development of new ideas in Arti cial Intelligence. This paper follows the same line, but concentrates on a very special class of chess problems known as \"helpmates\". These problems are generally more complex than normal problems since the two sides cooperate and thus there is no requirement for forcing variations. One relatively new area of research i n volves the use of constraints to reduce the problem space. As we shall see this idea can be applied successfully to helpmate problems. Logic Programming can serve a s a c o n venient programming scheme for constraint systems. So it is no surprise to meet Prolog-like languages in this eld. Several speci c constraint systems are available. To distinguish from other systems (for instance working over Boolean constraints), arithmetic constraints are characterised by restricting variables to numeric values. One of the rst attempts to use Constraint Logic Programming in the chess domain was done about two y ears ago 1] using the CLP(R) 1 . 2 system 2]. Unfortunately, CLP(R) processes linear constraints over oating point n umbers, which i s n o t v ery convenient in the nite domain of a chessboard. Therefore, the use of a constraint system with nite domains is more straightforward and investigations continue using the Oz system to this "

         "Abstract": "In order to discover the inner properties of human expert heuristics, which are successful in computer chess, to investigate these heuristics, improve them and, further, apply to various complex control systems, we develop a formal theory, the so-called Linguistic Geometry. This research includes the development of syntactic tools for knowledge representation and reasoning about the game of chess as about a hierarchical complex system. It relies on the formalization of search heuristics, which allow to decompose this game into the hierarchy of subsystems, and thus solve this problem reducing the search drastically. The hierarchy of subsystems is represented as a hierarchy of formal attribute languages. Syntactic tools generating the hierarchy of languages, the controlled grammars, are introduced in this paper. The performance of the grammar generating paths of pieces is considered in detail. The generation of the entire hierarchy of languages is considered on example of the R.Reti endgame.",
         "Introduction": "The group led by Prof. Botvinnik attacked the computer chess problem by simulating the method of a human chess master. The main idea was to replace a one-level complex system, as the game of chess use to be seen, by a multi-level hierarchical model that could allow us to break the system into subsystems, to search these subsystems separately and in combinations, and then combine optimal solutions for subsystems as approximately optimal for the entire system. This approach reduced the search drastically, down to a hundred of moves. However, the main difficulty was transferred from the development of efficient search methods to the design of methods for implementation of this decomposition."

It focuses on our parallel chess program \"Frenchess'' which, running on the Commissariat \u00e0 l'Energie Atomique's 128 processors T3D, just finished third of a field of 24 at the 8th World Computer Chess Championship in Hong Kong (May 25 -May 30 1995). Frenchess relies on the new ABDADA (Alpha Beta Distribu\u00e9 Avec Droit d'A\u00eenesse) algorithm, an efficient and easy to implement parallel version of the alpha-beta algorithm (which was formerly known not to parallelize well). ABDADA had first been tested on a TMC CM5 and a Cray CS6400, and the adaptation to the CRAY T3D, using SHMEM, has proved very satisfying. Even though single PE performance was disappointing, the T3D gave us excellent parallel performance, proving that our ABDADA algorithm scales very well up to at least 128 processors (with a speedup of over 70 in tournament conditions), and that it takes full advantage of the T3D's fast parallel architecture : it enabled us to build a world class chess program in just a few months' work. The ABDADA algorithm can certainly be useful for the parallelization of related problems, such as Branch and Bound problems, on this architecture.",

The standard approach i s t o g r o w a full width tree as deep as time allows, and then value the tree as if the leaf evaluations were exact. This has been e ective i n many games because of the computational e ciency of the Alphabeta algorithm. But as Bayesians, we w ant t o k n o w t h e b e s t w ay to use the inexact statistical information provided by the leaf evaluator to choose our next move. We add a model of uncertainty to the standard evaluation function. Within such a formal model, there is an optimal tree growth procedure and an optimal method of valuing the tree. We describe how to optimally value the tree within our model, and how to e ciently approximate the optimal tree to search. Our tree growth procedure provably approximates the contribution of each leaf to the utility in the limit where we g r o w a large tree, taking explicit account of the interactions between expanding di erent l e a ves. Our algorithms run (under reasonable assumptions) in linear time and hence except for a small constant factor, are as time e cient as Alpha-beta. I n a g i v en amount o f time our algorithm can thus, at least in principle, grow a tree several times as deep as Alpha-beta along the lines judged most relevant, but at a cost of expanding su ciently less along lines judged less relevant s o t h a t a small constant factor fewer nodes are searched in total. Our algorithm will apportion a greater fraction of its thinking time to more relevant m o ves, and will appropriately weigh the relevance of each leaf in choosing its move once it is nished searching. Empirical evidence of the e cacy of this approach i s p r e s e n ted in part 2.",
         "Introduction": "The standard method for computers to play games like chess, rst suggested by Shannon 32] , is to grow a f u l l width game tree as deeply as time permits, heuristically assign a numerical evaluation to each leaf, propagate these numbers up the tree by minimax, and choose as the \\best move\" the child of the root with the largest number. In practice, this computation is speeded up dramatically by the \\Alpha-beta\" algorithm, which allows one to prune o large sections of the search tree while still rigorously guaranteeing to evaluate "

         "Introduction": "Research in many AI domains has focussed on tasks that two and three year olds find easy. This has to do with primitive abilities that are difficult to capture algorithmically. The ability to recognize patterns, and actuate plans based upon such patterns is crucial to even low level behavior. Computer systems have trouble recognizing an \"office scene\" because they somehow don't \"get\" it is an office scene after having identified a few key objects. They have similar problems in speech understanding and in playing chess. The issue is always the same; if we only had more patterns and a plan to go with each, we would be in good shape."

         "Abstract": "Games are an interesting and challenging domain for computer science research, having the nice characteristics of a clearly de ned set of rules and a speci c goal. Developing a program to play a strategic game well often involves the application of theoretical concepts to practical situations, and the relative success of that endeavour can be measured with quanti able results.",
         "Introduction": "The area of computer strategic game playing has a history almost as long as computer science itself. Strategic games have proven to be a worthwhile domain for study, and many prominent gures in computer science have d e v oted time to the study of computer chess and other skill-testing games. Some of these luminaries include John Von Neumann, Alan Turing, Claude Shannon, John McCarthy, D o n a l d K n uth, Alan Newell, Herbert Simon, Arthur Samuel, Donald Michie, and Ken "

A 10 x 9 guard matrix is generated by FCM t o show the status of each intersection. Each entry in the matrix is called a guard value which indicates how an intersection is guarded by the player's side or attacked by the opponent's. We also reason the best next move with 36 rules by the membership functions of guard values. Based on the proposed model, not only the legitimacy of the next move can be improved but also the decision time is much shorter than the game tree searching method of alpha-beta model. An example is given t o verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Also, a multi-step decision method is presented to double check the legitimacy of this work. .",

Chess-playing programs are CPU-bound, but they are also difficult to parallelize. In fact, to build a strong parallel chess program is much more difficult than building a strong sequential chess program, because there are many special problems introduced by parallelism: most heuristics developed to improve the performance of the alphabeta algorithm do not scale well to distributed implementations "

This paper proposes the use of simulated experts, i.e., other knowledge based systems as sources of expertise in assessing knowledge acquisition tools. A simulated expert is not as creative or wise as a human expert, but it readily allows for controlled experiments. This method has been used to assess a knowledge acquisition methodology, Ripple Down Rules at various levels of expertise and shows that redundancy is not a major problem with RDR.",
         "Introduction": "Evaluation of knowledge acquisition (KA) methods remains an important goal. Many KA methods have been proposed and many tools have been developed. However, the critical issue for any developer of knowledge based systems (KBS) is to select the best KA technique for the task in hand. This means that papers describing methods need to provide convincing evidence of the particular advantage of the method over other methods and clear identification of the problems and weaknesses of a method. Unless this clear evidence is provided it is very hard to be sure whether or not to believe the author, who with the best will in the world, is mainly concerned to highlight the advantages he or she believes are provided by the new method they are proposing. As an example, it seems there are still very few case studies of maintenance problems with KBS, e.g. "

This assumes, of course that the bishops are on opposite colored squares and that the king is initially guarding the two bishops, say king on d4, and bishops on d5 and e5 as in the diagram below. In the following, we take the player with the two bishops to be white and his opponent to be black.",
         "Introduction": "Interestingly, there does not exist a strategy for white that wins with probability one in this position when nothing is known as to the whereabouts of the black king. What we can say is that for every > 0 there is a strategy for white that wins with probability at least 1 -no matter where black starts and what strategy black uses. In the terminology of game theory, there exists an -optimal strategy for white for every > 0 and the value of the position is a win for white. The reason there does not exist an optimal strategy for white is that white cannot reach a position in which he need guard the bishops only on one side. In particular, he cannot reach the side of the board without risking losing one of the bishops or allowing a possible stalemate. If he does reach the side of the board successfully, he has a strategy that mates surely in a finite number of moves without using randomization as will be seen later. He can safely move towards the edge, for example in the above position, by Bc4, Kd5, Bd4, Kc5, reaching the following critical position."

         "Abstract": "As a research topic computer game playing has contributed problems to AI that manifest exponential growth in the problem space. For the most part, in games such a~ chess and checkers these problems have been surmounted with enormous computing power on brute-force search methods using massive databases. It remains to be seen whether such techniques will extend to other games such as go ~nd shogi. One suggestion is that these games and even chess might benefit from a knowledge-based treatment but such approaches have met with limited success. The problem, as ever from such approaches, is the characterisation of the knowledge to be used by the system. This paper deals with the TAL system, which employs case-based reasoning techniques for chess playing. In the paper, rather than focus on playing, we concentrate on the automatic generation of suitable case knowledge using a chunking technique on a corpus of grandmaster games.",
         "Introduction": "Many games like chess and checkers have been mastered by computational techniques that use extensive search with massive computing power. The failure of such techniques to deal with other games, like go and shogi, is perhaps an indication that this approach does not constitute a general solution to such problems. One alternative is to use knowledge-based techniques, like case-based reasoning, to reduce the search overhead and speed-up solution generation. After all, human chess players play quite well, with relatively little search, through the use of extensive past experience. Several knowledge-based solutions have been attempted but with limited success (e.g. "

         "Abstract": "Experimental and computer simulation were used to study problem representation, solution strategies, and the relation between the two when solving problems in solitaire chess. Experimental results showed that subjects produced three kinds of problem representations, corresponding to three kinds of solution strategies; namely, trial-and-error, concentration and decomposition. The three different problem representations reflected different cognitive levels achieved by the subjects in structuring the problem and determined which solution strategy the subjects employed. The three kinds of solution strategies exhibited different kinds of selectivity and different degrees of effectiveness.",

         "Abstract": "The problem of transforming the knowledge bases of expert systems using induced rules or decision trees into comprehensible knowledge structures is addressed. A knowledge structure is developed that generalizes and subsumes production rules, decision trees, and rules with exceptions. It gives rise to a natural complexity measure that allows them to be understood, analyzed and compared on a uniform basis. The structure is a directed acyclic graph with the semantics that nodes are premises, some of which have attached conclusions, and the arcs are inheritance links with disjunctive multiple inheritance. A detailed example is given of the generation of a range of such structures of equivalent performance for a simple problem, and the complexity measure of a particular structure is shown to relate to its perceived complexity. The simplest structures are generated by an algorithm that factors common sub-premises from the premises of rules. A more complex example of a chess dataset is used to show the value of this technique in generating comprehensible knowledge structures.",

         "Abstract": "In this paper we introduce some search strategies under the general term SST (Search Strategy for Tutoring) intended to be used in tutoring games. Contrary to principles of tutoring game-playing programs stated elsewhere, we argue that tutoring systems not necessarily should interrupt games or provide explicit advice. In addition, unlike earlier tutoring strategies, SST does not depend on a prior model of the opponent's strength and knowledge. After an intuitive example in TicTacToe we formalize the idea of SST and give three types of SST strategies, based on minimum and maximum loss limits. Moreover, depending on the opponent's response to a move, a meta-SST strategy is de ned for each of the three SST strategies. The SST strategies are then illustrated by easyto-implement algorithms, which are exemplied by a sample search tree. The main conclusion is that SST provides a vehicle for realization of hidden tutoring in game-playing programs, adapting automatically to the user's strength.",
         "Introduction": "This paper introduces a new strategy for tutoring in game playing, called SST (Search Strategy for Tutoring). In a previous paper, we proposed two kinds of game-tree search strategies with a purpose of tutoring: LO-search and TU-search. They allow a player to lose a game or at least to give his opponent some potential to win, without this being noticed by the opponent "

In this paper, we propose a case-based model that supplies a comprehensive positional analysis for any given position. This analysis contains evaluative comments for the most significant basic features found in the position and a general evaluation for the entire position. The analysis of the entire position is presented by an appropriate Multiple explanation Pattern (MXP), while the analysis of each chosen feature is presented by a suitable eXplanation Pattern (XP). The proposed analysis can improve weak and intermediate players' play in general and their understanding, evaluating and planning abilities in particular. This model is part of an intelligent educational chess system which is under development. At present, our model deals only with a static evaluation of chess positions; addition of searching and playing modules remains for future work.",

StarTech employs the Jamboree search algorithm, a natural extension of J. Pearl's Scout search algorithm, to \u00aend parallelism in game-tree searches. StarTech's work-stealing scheduler distributes the work speci\u00aeedby the search algorithm across the processors of the CM-5. StarTech uses a global transposition table shared among the processors. StarTech has an informally estimated rating of over 2400 USCF.",
         "Introduction": "Computer chess provides a good testbed for understanding dynamic multithreaded computations. The parallelism in computer chess is derived from a dynamic expansion of a highly irregular game-tree, which has historically made it dif\u00aecultto implement parallel computer chess programs and other dynamic applications. To investigate how to program such applications, I engineered a parallel chess program called StarTech (pronounced \u00aaStar -Tek\u00ba) on the Connection Machine CM-5. Even though my primary area of research is in parallel computing rather than computer This research was supported in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (DoD) under Grants N00014-94-1-0985, N00014-92-J-1310, and N00014-91-J-1698. chess, the StarTech project has produced some interesting computer chess technology.

Results indicate that the use of transposition tables can reduce the size of the game tree by as much as 95%, significantly improving the algorithmic performance of \u03b1\u03b2 search. Seven replacement schemes to handle collisions in transposition tables were proposed and their performance measured. Based on the results of the experiment it can be concluded that for large-sized tables all schemes perform nearly identically. Because of the probability of the collisions is inversely proportional to the size of the table, for smaller sizes two level replacement schemes outperformed the single-level implementations.",

The technology suggests ways to sharpen traditional and present pedagogical practices in various performance disciplines, and in some cases proposes new methods and techniques of learning and practicing. This book does not deal with the analysis of \"talent,\" nor with the issues of genetic versus learned origins of high levels of expert achievement, motivational factors, or with correlations between high levels of expert achievement and other attributes, all of which topics are the subject of an extensive literature (e.g., "

         "Abstract": "Expert chess players can recall meaningful chess positions with extraordinary precision in comparison with inexperienced players. We hypothesized, therefore, that their mental performance during chess deliberation could be an appropriate target for single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) studies. We studied cerebral activation with 1110 MBq 99mTc-Bicisate SPECT in five expert male chess players during mental solution of a complex chess problem. Region of interest (ROI) analysis, in comparison with average weighted cerebellar counts, showed activation by 10% or more, of the non dominant prefrontal area (fight in four dominant right handed players, left in one dominant left handed player) and by 2-6% in the non-dominant middle temporal areas. Maximum variability of ROI analysis versus cerebellar counts in test/retest evaluation is in our laboratory, as in others, 1.5%. Our results are in agreement with neuropsychological studies suggesting that the non-dominant hemisphere is specialized for chess skill, and show that non-dominant prefrontal and temporal lobe activation during chess deliberation can be detected by SPECT.",

Most of these systems, however, lack the ability to refine their network's topology and are thus unable to add new rules to the (reformulated) rule base. Therefore, with domain theories that lack rules, generalization is poor, and training can corrupt the original rules --even those that were initially correct. The paper presents TopGen, an extension to the KBANN algorithm, which heuristically searches for possible expansions to the KBANN network. TopGen does this by dynamically adding hidden nodes to the neural representation of the domain theory, in a manner that is analogous to the adding of rules and conjuncts to the symbolic rule base. Experiments indicate that the method is able to heuristically find effective places to add nodes to the knowledge bases of four real-world problems, as well as an artificial chess domain. The experiments also verify that new nodes must be added in an intelligent manner. The algorithm showed statistically significant improvements over the KBANN algorithm in all five domains.",
         "Introduction": "account for the training data. While it is clearly important to classify the examples as accurately as possible, changes to the initial domain theory should be kept to a minimum because the domain theory presumably contains useful information, even if it is not completely correct. Also, large changes to the domain theory can greatly complicate rule extraction following training "

We prove their suitability for practical use by presenting test results with a tournament level chess program.",

         "Abstract": "We p r e s e n t a new paradigm for minimax search algorithms: MT, a memory-enhanced version of Pearl's Test procedure. By changing the way MT is called, a number of practical best-rst search algorithms can be simply constructed. Reformulating SSS* as an instance of MT eliminates all its perceived implementation drawbacks. Most assessments of minimax search performance are based on simulations that do not address two k ey ingredients of high performance game-playing programs: iterative deepening and memory usage. Instead, we use experimental data gathered from tournament checkers, Othello and chess programs. The use of iterative deepening and memory makes our results di er signi cantly from the literature. One new instance of our framework, MTD(f), out-performs our best Alpha-Beta searcher on leaf nodes, total nodes and execution time. To our knowledge, these are the rst reported results that compare both depth-rst and bestrst algorithms given the same amount of memory.",

We argue that individuals skilled in a domain develop expertise because they know and apply these principles, and that most game-playing programs do not play like people. The paper describes Hoyle, a model of an expert game player that relies on the use of commonsense principles, limited memory, and useful knowledge to learn to play two-person, perfect information finite-board games expertly. We then describe an experiment in which human subjects played three such games against a computer expert. After playing these games, the subjects evaluated Hoyle's game-playing principles in the context of their own behavior. Verbal protocols and subjects' evaluations revealed considerable overlap between the principles preferred by our subjects and those preferred by Hoyle. Using learning time as a measure of difficulty, the subjects' performance and Hoyle's performance ordered the three games identically. This experiment also revealed differences in the use of gameplaying principles between skilled and unskilled players: skilled players judged the game-playing principles to be more effective than did unskilled players, skilled players used several different principles while unskilled players relied on one principle, and skilled players anticipated their opponent's moves while unskilled players merely reacted.",
         "Introduction": "The use of transferable commonsense principles as a hallmark of expertise is the subject of this paper. It is the thesis of this work that an individual skilled in a particular domain is able to develop expertise more thoroughly and more rapidly because she knows and applies a set of commonsense principles. Our research is based in the domain of two-person, perfect information, finite-board games. We argue that most game-playing programs do not play like people, and present a model of expert game playing called Hoyle, which implements commonsense gameplaying principles. We describe an experiment that identifies some of the commonsense principles people use, and offers psychological evidence that the ability to use and evaluate commonsense principles is one of the differences between skilled and unskilled human game-players. Further, we discuss the plausibility of Hoyle as a cognitive model of human expert game playing."

         "Abstract": "This paper describes an experiment to assess the influence of immersion on performance in immersive virtual environments. The task involved Tri-Dimensional Chess, and required subjects to reproduce on a real chess board the state of board learned from a sequence of moves witnessed in a virtual environment. Twenty four subjects were allocated to a factorial design consisting of two levels of immersion (exocentric screen based, and egocentric HMD based), and two kinds of environment (plain and realistic. The results suggest that egocentric subjects performed better than exocentric, and those in the more realistic environment performed better than those in the less realistic environment. Previous knowledge of chess, and amount of virtual practice were also significant, and may be considered as control variables to equalise these factors amongst the subjects. Other things being equal, males remembered the moves better than females, although female performance improved with higher spatial ability test score. The paper also attempts to clarify the relationship between immersion, presence and performance, and locates the experiment within such a theoretical framework.",
         "Introduction": "Here the question is whether skills or knowledge gained in a virtual environment can be successfully transferred to the real world. Suppose that a person learns to perform some task in a virtual environment, does immersion improve the chance of transfer of such knowledge to the real world? A previous attempt to study this "

There are now at least half a dozen commercial programs which will play at International Master strength on a DX486 personal computer. In this article we look at the program GnuChess, from the Free Software Foundation, which is probably the most popular chess program which can be downloaded from the Internet. It can be obtained from the site //ftp.give.site//. GnuChess plays like a good club player and can beat almost all chess players who don't play seriously. Like all chess programs, however, it does have some weaknesses which we will explore here.",
         "Introduction": "Compared with humans, computers are less selective in the way that they calculate variations. Humans make occasional simple blunders but can calculate specific variations at great depth when the need arises. Computers have far more trouble deciding which variations are important and instead go for a blunderbuss approach, calculating all possibilities to a limited depth. One way to defeat a computer therefore is to present it with a tempting continuation which looks good in the short term but which is eventually to its disadvantage."

         "Introduction": "A nyone who plays chess knows that some games just peter out : neither player seems able to win, nothing constructive can be done and there is no obvious way to end the game. If neither player agrees to a draw, the game might go on inde\u00denitely. Foreseeing such situations, the bodies that frame the laws of chess have proposed many di\u00dderent rules to force games to end. The classic law states that the game shall be drawn if a player proves that 50 moves have been made on each side, checkmate has not been given, no men have been captured and no pawn has been moved."

         "Introduction": "The legacy of the New Criticism and the old historicism has been the sepa ration of aesthetic from cognitive analysis. The end-of-the-century challenge for cultural studies is to overcome the false dichotomy this implies. I refer not only to the genteel contempt for cultural categories (class, race, gender), but to the cultural protest against the claims of art. Let me say at once that I endorse the protest. Reverence for art, like all forms of idolatry, is the road to mystification. It may be said of some current forms of aesthetic appreciation what has been said of metaphysics in general: \"We think we actually under stand things only when we have traced them back to what we do not under stand-to causality, to axioms, to God\"; I or in this case, to genius and the daemonic, to taste, tact, and sensibility. But the current process of demysti fication, as registered in debates over canon and value, has worked to widen the gap between the constitutive parts of literary history. It's as though the cultural critics, in their aversion to the romantic and postromantic iconog Icvan Bercovitch raphy of the text, had simply left aesthetics to the aesthetes; as though, in their irritation with the pretensions of high culture, they had cut the body of literature in two, as in Solomon's judgment about the disputed baby. You get beauty, we get substance.\""

         "Introduction": "Research in many AI domains has focussed on tasks that two and three year olds find easy. This has to do with primitive abilities that are difficult to capture algorithmically. The ability to recognize patterns, and actuate plans based upon such patterns is crucial to even low level behavior. Computer systems have trouble recognizing an \"office scene\" because they somehow don't \"get\" it is an office scene after having identified a few key objects. They have similar problems in speech understanding and in playing chess. The issue is always the same; if we only had more patterns and a plan to go with each, we would be in good shape."

         "Abstract": "Cilk (pronounced ''silk'') is a C-based runtime system for multithreaded parallel programming. In this paper, we document the efficiency of the Cilk work-stealing scheduler, both empirically and analytically. We show that on real and synthetic applications, the ''work'' and ''critical-path length'' of a Cilk computation can be used to model performance accurately. Consequently, a Cilk programmer can focus on reducing the computation's work and critical-path length, insulated from load balancing and other runtime scheduling issues. We also prove that for the class of ''fully strict'' (well-structured) programs, the Cilk scheduler achieves space, time, and communication bounds all within a constant factor of optimal. The Cilk runtime system currently runs on the Connection Machine CM5 MPP, the Intel Paragon MPP, the Sun Sparcstation SMP, and the Cilk-NOW network of workstations. Applications written in Cilk include protein folding, graphic rendering, backtrack search, and the \u0afdSocrates chess program, which won second prize in the",
         "Introduction": ". A multithreaded system provides the programmer with a means to create, synchronize, and schedule threads. Although the schedulers in many of these runtime systems seem to perform well in practice, none provide users with a guarantee of application performance. Cilk is a runtime system whose work-stealing scheduler is efficient in theory as well as in practice. Moreover, it gives the user an algorithmic model of application performance based on the measures of ''work'' and ''critical-path length'' which can be used to predict the runtime of a Cilk program accurately."

We tested this approach on two-person, perfect information, finite-board games using a multi-agent game playing program as a platform for our experiments. From a pattern-oriented language based on small collections of markers, patterns that were persistently associated with wins, losses, and draws were stored in a pattern cache. These patterns were used to guide the decision-making of a pattern-based agent in the multi-agent game playing program. We then generalized over sets of patterns in the pattern cache to create new pattern-based concepts and then proceduralized those generalizations as new heuristic agents in the program. Finally, we validated both the agent based on the individual patterns and those agents proceduralized from the concepts formed from those patterns. This was done with an algorithm that compares their advice with the decisions of an expert opponent and weights their contribution to the decision-making process accordingly. This approach uses two kinds of pattern-oriented learning for game playing: the association of particular patterns with successful or unsuccessful play, and the construction of spatially-oriented heuristics from those patterns.

         "Abstract": "Fail High Reductions (FHR) is a new method to guide the search in game trees in a very selective manner. The main idea is that the search algorithm should not spend too much e ort searching subtrees, which look too good to become part of the principal variation even at their roots. More precisely, a fail high node is a node v with a search window ] at which a static evaluation function e produces a cuto . The FHR-algorithm reduces the search depths at these fail high nodes thus searching their subtrees with less e ort. FHR is domain independent in the sense that it only uses a static evaluation function, which a l w ays is assumed to exist, and the search windows to guide the search. In this paper we describe the incorporation of FHR in our chess program Zugzwang. Three di erent tests have been conducted to compare Zugzwang with and without FHR: First, we compare the results obtained from running the algorithm on the positions of the WinAtChess test suite. Second, we look at the results obtained from three matches of 50 games each. The games were played under tournament conditions between three di erent v ersions of Zugzwang each with and without FHR. Last but not least, we compare both versions by looking at the results of 100 games played against a chess program developed independently from Zugzwang. All three tests indicate that the FHR version is about 120 -150 ELO points stronger than the version without FHR. Moreover, from the second test we obtain the result that with statistical signi cance the FHR version is stronger than the regular version.",
         "Introduction": "The problem of evaluating trees appears in many applications, e.g. expert systems, proof systems or management tools use algorithms similar to the ones used in game playing programs. The crucial point is that the best known algorithms for determining the minimax value of the root search game trees of depth d and width w in O(w d=2 ) a verage running time, i.e. the running time is exponential in the depth of the game tree. Moreover, Knuth and Moore showed that (w d=2 ) i s a l o wer bound on the running time of any algorithm that evaluates a game tree of width w uniformly to depth d "

A knowledge structure is developed that generalizes and subsumes production rules, decision trees, and rules with exceptions. It gives rise to a natural complexity measure that allows them to be understood, analyzed and compared on a uniform basis. The structure is a directed acyclic graph with the semantics that nodes are premises, some of which have attached conclusions, and the arcs are inheritance links with disjunctive multiple inheritance. A detailed example is given of the generation of a range of such structures of equivalent performance for a simple problem, and the complexity measure of a particular structure is shown to relate to its perceived complexity. The simplest structures are generated by an algorithm that factors common sub-premises from the premises of rules. A more complex example of a chess dataset is used to show the value of this technique in generating comprehensible knowledge structures.",

In this paper, we introduce the design of a multithreaded distributed runtime system. Efficiency and ease of parallel programming are the two primary goals. In our system, multithreading is used to specify the asynchronous behavior in parallel game tree search, and dynamic load balancing is employed for efficient performance.",
         "Introduction": "Workstation networks are increasingly prevalent because of their versatility and the advantage of high scalability and cost-effectiveness over parallel machines. Many distributed programming systems such as PVM, P4, MPI, Linda and Express have been built. Most of them handle only a process-based message-passing paradigm that ably supports dataparallel applications with regular data structures and communication patterns. But, unfortunately, a large proportion of real-word applications are irregular. Pruned search, an important subset of these irregular applications, is central to solving a variety of problems in artificial intelligence. Compared with traditional data-parallel applications, search problems tend to be highly irregular and dynamic in nature and pose new challenges: (1) asynchronous behavior results in greater software complexity; "

Results show a decline of percentage of recall with additional boards, but also show that expert players recall more pieces than is predicted by the chunking theory in its original form. A second experiment shows that longer latencies between the presentation of boards facilitate recall. In a third experiment, a Chessmaster gradually increases the number of boards he can reproduce with higher than 70% average accuracy to nine, replacing as many as 160 pieces correctly. To account for the results of these experiments, a revision of the Chase-Simon theory is proposed.

Results show a decline of percentage of recall with additional boards, but also show that expert players recall more pieces than is predicted by the chunking theory in its original form. A second experiment shows that longer latencies between the presentation of boards facilitate recall. In a third experiment, a Chessmaster gradually increases the number of boards he can reproduce with higher than 70% average accuracy to nine, replacing as many as 160 pieces correctly. To account for the results of these experiments, a revision of the Chase-Simon theory is proposed. It is suggested that chess players, like experts in other recall tasks, use long-term memory retrieval structures ",

         "Abstract": "Chess has long served as an important standard task environment for research on human memory and problemsolving abilities and processes In this article, we report evidence on the relative importance of recognition processes and planning (look-ahead)  processes in very high level expert performance m chess The data show that the rated skill of a toplevel grand master is only slightly lower when he ts playing simultaneously against a half-dozen grand-master opponents than under tournament conditions that allow much more time for each move As simultaneous play allows little time for lookahead processes, the data indicate that recognition, based on superior chess knowledge, plays a much larger part in highlevel skill in this task than does planning by looking ahead For the past 20 years, there has been a general consensus, based on extensive laboratory research, that two psychological mechanisms play a principal role in skilled chess-playing performance The first mechanism is recognition of cues in chess positions that evoke information from the expert's memory about possible moves and other implications of recognized patterns of pieces The second mechanism is planning by looking ahead at possible moves, possible responses by the opponent, possible responses to those responses, and so on The chessbased model of expertise, emphasizing a combination of recognition and selective search processes, has been applied widely to the explanation of expertise in other domains involving complex specialized skills medical diagnosis, engineering and architectural design, and many others (Chamess, 1992, Encsson & Staszewski, 1989) The validity of this model is consequently of considerable interest and importance for the general understandmg of the nature of expert performance The role of recognition processes in chess-playmg skill was first recognized by De Groot (1946/1978), and studied further by Chase and Simon (1973), Simon and Chase (1973), Goldm (1979), Chamess (1981a, 1981b), Hartston and Wason (1983), Saanluoma (1985, 1989), Lones (1987), Gobet (1993), and others A key experimental result is that positions in chess games (with about 25 pieces on the board) can be stored in memory and reconstructed almost perfectly by masters and grand masters after as little as a 5-s view of the board, m contrast, under these same condiUons, weak players can recall only some halfdozen pieces As this supenonty of masters over weaker players nearly vanishes if the pieces are placed at random on the board instead of coming from posiUons in an actual game, it",
         "Introduction": "appears that the masters arc recognizing and storing familiar pattems of pieces, rather than individual pieces (Chase & Simon, 1973) From these expenments, one can conclude that the recognition process requires, at most, 1 to 5 s, in consistency with recognition processes in other tasks"

         "Abstract": "this very same conference, a young graduate student presented a paper unrelated to computer chess. It was 36 years after Claude Shannon's 1949 senlinal talk on chess computers. Chess computers had just crossed the milestone of playing at national master level, but were still a long way off from playing at Grandmaster level, let along challenging the World Champion. VLSI had recently been applied to the computer chess problem with some success. 'I'he graduate student had some ideas of his own, and with some: soul searching, decided to take the plunge after returning from the conference. Thts talk will describe what happened in the intervening years till now, including the match in February 1996 and the rematch in May 1997 between Deep Blue and Gary Kasparov, the World Champion.",
         "Introduction": "wrote an early article (1945) on computer chess. But the ball did not really get rolling until Claude Shannon gave his 1949 computer chess lecture at the National Convention of the Institute of Radio Engineers (precursor to the present day IEEE). Alan Turing, whom the most prestigious award in computer science is named after, did his hand simulation of a chess program on the other side of the Atlantic shortly after "

Thus, in order to lose a game against an opponent, it may be reasonable to choose a move at a max node that leads to a successor whose value is not the best. A definition of LO-search now is the following: a search strategy that chooses a move taking the opponent model into account at a min position and maximizing the value by OM-search at a max position, provided that the latter is less than the value by the minimax strategy from the max player's point of view. If there is no such successor at a max position, a move minimizing the value by OM-search is chosen."

         "Abstract": "Perfect knowledge about a domain renders search unnecessary and, likewise, exhaustive search obviates heuristic knowledge. In practise, a tradeoff is found somewhere in the middle, since neither extreme is feasible for interesting domains. During the last two decades, the focus for increasing the performance of two-player game-playing programs has been on enhanced search, usually by faster hardware and/or more efficient algorithms. This paper revisits the issue of the relative advantages of improved search and knowledge. It introduces a revised search-knowledge tradeoff graph that is supported by experimental evidence for three different games: chess, Othello and checkers, using a new metric: the \"noisy oracle\". Previously published results in chess seem to contradict our model, postulating a linear increase in program strength with increasing search depth. We show that these results are misleading, and are due to properties of chess and chess-playing programs, not to the search-knowledge tradeoff.",
         "Introduction": "Many experiments have been performed in game-playing programs that measure the benefits of improved knowledge and/or deeper search. In particular, chess has been a popular application for these experiments. The explicit or implicit message of these works is that the results for chess are generalizable to other games. There have been few studies that examined the impact of improved knowledge on program performance "

Two notions, priority and simulation, are defined for this method. A given problem is solved step-by-step according to the priority. Simulation often allows us to omit searching on each step. A program made by the author and based on this method solved a celebrated problem requiring over 600 plies (half-moves) to mate.",
         "Introduction": "It would be useful in board games if the experience learned from one position could be applied to other, similar, positions. However, positions that seem to only slightly differ on the board can actually differ greatly in terms of strategy. This paper proposes a method that uses information on similar positions to solve Tsume-shogi problems (mating problems in Japanese chess, the rules of which are explained in Section 2)."

         "Abstract": "Among the great writers of our century, Vladimir Nabokov is undoubtedly the one in whose work playing and games demand most critical attention. In both literal and figurative dimensions Nabokov, from his youth in Russia, the years spent in exile among the Russian community in Berlin in the 1920s and 1930s, through to the American and Swiss periods of his career, was preoccupied with playing games. Whether as card or board games, ball games or games involving the use of words, they invariably turned into themes and analogies of art and the writing process. 1 Chess in particular engaged Nabokov's creative interest ever since the early games against his father and other relations in St. Petersburg, Cambridge and Berlin. 2 An imaginary portrait of the Russian emigre community in a Berlin caf\u00e9 in the early 1920s that Jewgenij Jewtuschenko has just published shows Vladimir. Sirin (alias Nabokov) involved in solitary study with a miniature set of onyx chessmen pointedly ignoring Viktor Shklovsky at the next table . \n\n3 Biographically, the composition of chess problems, more than tournament play, was one of Nabokov's serious extra-literary occupations, to be rivalled only by the study of butterflies. In his fictionalized autobiography Speak, Memory, the author put the art of chess problem composition on a level with his own poetry, and he deliberately placed the two arts side by side int one book (in Poems and Problems)* In prose, Nabokov surpasses other modernist writers -T.S.",
         "Introduction": "Eliot, Ezra Pound, Stefan Zweig, Elias Canetti, Louis MacNeice a.s.o.-whose work like his own uses chess imagery. Like Samuel Beckett in his first novel Murphy, Nabokov had a strong affinity with the so-called hypermodern school of chess innovators, some of whom -like Aaron Nimzowitsch -he met across the board in simultaneous matches in the 1920s."

This lack of sumegic foundations maims most chess playing pro~mns inadequate as chess tutors too. This paper presents a new approach for computer chess in ~ and specifically for a lenming environment for chess. This approach combines the wclmiqnes of fuzzy logic and casebnsed renmning in order to produce hish level edvice for cbess pnsitions. We also lnsent the resulm of the mnpirkal experiments used to test ICONCEIESS and suggest some ways in which the aplronch can be applied to other domains.",

         "Abstract": "Most computer science students know the rules of chess. Many of them are interested in the game at least on the level that they play on occasion. We can take advantage of this interest by organizing projects on chess related topics.",
         "Introduction": "implementing a correspondence chess companion does not require much chess knowledge. It is enough to know the rules of the game in order to program the analysis feature, an interface to manipulate a chessboard on a screen according to the rules in order to help the user to find the best possible next move. This project took place on spring 1994. There were five participants divided into two subgroups (a Macintosh group and a PC group). The two versions naturally have also some parts in common. Provided that all the five participants were worked for a single implementation, this project would have been a success."

         "Introduction": "'Chess is the intellectual game par excellence.' -wrote Newell, Shaw and Simon in their paper published in the IBM Journal of Research and Development in 1958 which traced the development of digital computer programs that play chess. They believed that the efforts to program chess provided an indication of the then current progress in understanding and constructing complex and intelligent mechanisms."

A chess playing computer is an existence proof of a machine doing something thought to require intelligence. Chess programs have three major components: move generation, search and evaluation. The speed of a chess program depends on the quality of the mechanisms used to prune search of unprofitable continuations. The most reliable pruning method in popular use is the alpha-beta algorithm. This paper presents a parallel alpha-beta searching algorithm and examines the performance of its implementation.",
         "Introduction": "The problem of playing chess can be defined as a problem of moving around in a state space where each state corresponds to a legal position of the board. The goal state is any board position in which the opponent does not have a legal move and his king is under attack. Chess has an average branching factor of about 35 and games often go to 50 moves by each player, so the search tree has about 35 100 nodes. Exploring each of the node in this huge search tree is not at all feasible. However it is possible to cut off some of the subtrees using a method called alpha-beta pruning. This paper develops a parallel alpha-beta search algorithm. Section 2 discusses the concepts of game playing. Section 3 develops the parallel alpha-beta searching algorithm. Section 4 focuses on the implementation of the parallel algorithm. Section 5 examines the performance of the parallel solution. Section 6 provides a summary and directions for further research."

Its success is largely attributable to a variety of enhancements to the basic algorithm that can dramatically improve the search efficiency. Although state-ofthe-art game-playing programs build trees that are close in size to the minimal Alpha-Beta search tree, this paper shows that there is still room for improvement. Three new enhancements are presented: best-first Alpha-Beta search, better use of transpositions, and improving aspiration search under real-time constraints. Measurements show that these improvements can reduce search effort by 35%.",

The task involved Tri-Dimensional Chess, and required subjects to reproduce on a real chess board the state of the board learned from a sequence of moves witnessed in a virtual environment. Twenty four subjects were allocated to a factorial design consisting of two levels of immersion (exocentric screen based, and egocentric HMD based), and two kinds of environment (plain and realistic. The results suggest that egocentric subjects performed better than exocentric, and those in the more realistic environment performed better than those in the less realistic environment. Previous knowledge of chess, and amount of virtual practice were also significant, and may be considered as control variables to equalise these factors amongst the subjects. Other things being equal, males remembered the moves better than females, although female performance improved with higher spatial ability test score. The paper also attempts to clarify the relationship between immersion, presence and performance, and locates the experiment within such a theoretical framework.",
         "Introduction": "This paper describes an experiment to compare task performance of twenty-four subjects with respect to immersive and non-immersive participation and interaction in a virtual environment (VE). Subjects participated in and observed a sequence of events played out in relation to a complex geometrical structure, and their task was the subsequent reproduction of those events with respect to the real world equivalent of that structure. Half the subjects participated in a visually immersive VE, and the remainder in a nonimmersive VE. A secondary independent variable was the realism of the displayed environment. The task involved the reproduction of moves of pieces in the Tri-Dimensional chess game popularised in the TV series Star Trek. One inspiration of this work was the question posed by "

B P m a i n tains a probabilistic model of its uncertainty and uses it to grow its search tree in the most relevant directions, and to value the tree's nodes. Here we describe the rst implementations of this algorithm and report on experiments comparing it with the standard (alpha-beta, or AB) approach, and the \\probability product\" (PP) approach, in several popular games. BP is seen to evaluate a xed tree more accurately than either AB or PP in a large variety of games. BP is seen to beat strong alpha-beta programs in Othello and Warri even when the alpha-beta programs are given substantially greater computational resources. We elucidate which conditions favor BP and which f a vor AB. We h a ve i n vented several important BP-gameplayer engineering tricks in the course of this research, such a s t h e \\ m ultispike trick\" and new methods of evaluation function design. More such tricks undoubtably remain to be discovered.",
         "Introduction": "1.1 Three ways to valuate a tree: BP, AB, and PP In a companion paper 7] , we proposed a Bayesian procedure for making computers play games such as chess. We call this procedure \\BP\". The BP approach both values a given search tree di erently (each n o d e is associated with a probability distribution, rather than a number themove with largest mean is chosen) and grows a more selective tree (leaves with large \\expansion importance\" based on certain Bayesian principles, are expanded) than standard approaches. Shannon 49] proposed that computers select their move according to the minimax value of a full width subtree, with numerical leaf values assigned by some readily computed, heuristic evaluation function. The alpha-beta (AB) procedure speeds up the minimaxing. Various heuristic improvements such as \\move ordering\" and \\iterative deepening\" allow alpha-beta to achieve in practice nearly its theoretical limit speed up, i.e. to search i n a given time nearly twice as deep a full width tree as would be searched by a naive tree searcher. Other heuristics attempt to extend search along hopefully important lines or retract search on hopefully unimportant lines. Alpha-beta, with heuristic improvements, has been the search engine in virtually every high-performance game program since its invention, including games of chess, checkers, and Othello where computers are comparable to or better than human experts"

During the past few years, parallel algorithms have evolved from fixed master-slave relationships, where the master looked for slaves to complete its task, to more dynamic master-slave relationships, where unemployed processors look for a master in order to find some task to do. But those master-slave relationships, which are exemplified by the work-stealing schedulers of Jamboree[l2] and YBWC[i'] still suffer from synchronization overheads."

The term \"agoric,\" from \"agora,\" the Greek word for marketplace, was introduced in a series of articles by Mark Miller and Eric Drexler in 1988 [Miller88]. The field has been slow to gain traction since then. This paper describes an agoric system that learns to play competently at a simple two-player game, Nim, using a market where positions in the games are auctioned. Suggestions as to how the design could be extended along different dimensions are included. Avenues for future research and experimentation are proposed. Complete Ruby source code and unit tests are attached.",
         "Introduction": "Agoric software is software that is organized internally using markets to establish prices, where software agents compete for access to resources and for the right to solve problems or subproblems. In contrast traditional software is organized exclusively using command and control principles, where the actions of the program are under some centralized control. Centralized control may be a feature of some agoric systems, including the example put forward here, but it is not the dominant one."

Deep Blue had played Kasparov in February 1996. It lost the match, though it won one of the games. That was the first time a computer had beaten Kasparov in a game with real tournament conditions. In May this year Kasparov agreed to play a rematch with Deep Blue. Deep Blue won the rematch, 3.5 points to 2.5 points. Kasparov and Deep Blue went into the last game level at 2.5 points each. Deep Blue played white in this game. The game lasted less than an hour and in 19 moves Kasparov resigned. This is the first time he has lost a match to an opponent since becoming world champion in 1985. Post-match analysis showed that Kasparov made a blunder on move 7 which led to his quick defeat. Deep Blue (rather it's team) got the first prize of $700,000 and Kasparov got $400,000.",

As I regard chess in East Asia a fascinating field in itself, my paramount interest is to delve into the origins, the history, and the development of chess and chess-like games. Although I will refrain from speculations on the connections between Chinese Chess and the Indian and Persian chess-games, the reader is invited to draw whatever conclusions himself. However, I hope I will succeed in making obvious that Chinese Chess and its forerunners have a sound claim to necessarily be allowed for by anyone dealing with the history of chess."

The alpha-beta algorithm implements this with great computational efficiency. This approach has been effective in many games. Our approach is to form a Bayesian model of our uncertainty. We adopt an evaluation function that returns a probability distribution estimating the probability of various errors in valuing each position. These estimates are obtained by training from data. We thus use additional information at each leaf not available to the standard approach. We utilize this information in three ways: to evaluate which move is best after we are done expanding, to allocate additional thinking time to moves where additional time is most relevant to game outcome, and, perhaps most importantly, to expand the tree along the most relevant lines. Our measure of the relevance of expanding a given leaf provably approximates a measure of the impact of expanding the leaf on expected payoff, including the impact of the outcome of the leaf expansion on later expansion decisions. Our algorithms run (under reasonable assumptions) in time linear in the size of the final tree and hence except for a small constant factor, are as time efficient as alpha-beta.

Unfortunately, many such problems are known to be NP-complete or NP-hard, which means that no really fast algorithm for optimal solutions can be expected to be found."

We view this work as a first step towards the goal of improving existing forward-pruning methods.",
         "Introduction": "The thinking-process used by computers for playing chess and other two-person games differs significantly from the one used by humans. While humans consider at most a few alternatives when deciding what to play, computers exhaustively search all the possible moves. In the half century since minimax was first suggested as a strategy for adversary game search, various algorithms have been developed, most notably Alpha-Beta and its variants. The Alpha-Beta like algorithms, as formulated, explore all continuations to some fixed depth. However, in practice the algorithms are not used that way, instead various heuristics are used that allow them to vary the search horizon, exploring some moves more deeply than others. In an indirect way, this resembles the human approach. Continuations that are thought to be of interest are expanded beyond the nominal depth, while others of less interest are terminated prematurely. The latter case is referred to as forward pruning."

         "Abstract": "Kriegspiel is an heterodox Chess variation in which the players have incomplete information because they are not informed of their opponent's position and moves. In fact, each player knows the position of his own pieces, but he can only guess the position of enemy pieces. Each player tries to guess the position of the opponent's pieces as the game progresses by trying moves that can be either legal or illegal with respect to the real situation: a referee accepts legal moves and rejects illegal ones; the latter are useful to gain insight about the situation. This means that players have to play in a context of uncertainty and partial information. We know of no past attempts to build Kriegspiel playing programs. This paper describes the design of a program which plays a class of Kriegspiel positions using a knowledge base which implements a \"rational approach\". The program we have developed integrates two different notions of rationality introduced by Simon: the substantive and the procedural rationality [Sim76,Sim78]. The interesting part of such an experience is how the procedural rational approach can incorporate results obtained with substantive rationality, whereas the two approaches are usually considered alternative.",
         "Introduction": "checkmate are the same as in Chess. 2. The player P who has to move communicates his move to the referee only; the opponent O will not have such an information. 3. If the move is illegal, the referee answers to P that the move is illegal; then P has to try another move going back to point 2. P usually gains information on the state of O's pieces from such a failed try. 4. If the move is legal, the referee announces to both players that a move has been played legally and adds these pieces of information: If a piece has been captured (and which kind); If a check has been given (and on which row, column, or diagonal); If the game is terminated because of mate, stalemate, or insufficient material."

Furthermore, researchers of arti cial intelligence seem to be increasingly willing to cite Deep Blue as an example of success (e.g. (SBD + 96)). The topic of computer chess, and game-playing in general, has also enjoyed a considerable resurgence of signi cant and creative r esearch, particularly in the areas of search and machine learning (as we shall discuss later)."

This paper shows that both methods involve fundamentally the same process of propagating information backward from the goal toward the starting state. Most RL methods perform this propagation on a state-by-state basis, while EBL methods compute the weakest preconditions of operators, and hence, perform this propagation on a region-by-region basis. ",
         "Introduction": "Speedup learning is a form of learning in which an inefficient problem solver is transformed into an efficient one. It is often easy to specify and implement an inefficient problem solver for a task, whereas implementing an efficient problem solver can be very difficult. For example, in the game of chess, an inefficient problem solver can be implemented as an exhaustive search algorithm that applies the rules of the game. An efficient problem solver would need to transform those rules into a near-optimal policy for choosing moves in the game. Similarly, the problem of job-shop scheduling can be solved by a simple problem solver that generates and tests all possible schedules. An efficient problem solver must exploit particular properties of the job shop and the job mix to find efficient search heuristics. There are many important applications that could benefit from effective speedup learning algorithms."

         "Abstract": "Compression measures used in inductive learners, such as measures based on the MDL (Minimum Description Length) principle, provide a theoretically justified basis for grading candidate hypotheses. Compression-based induction is appropriate also for handling of noisy data. This paper shows that a simple compression measure can be used to detect noisy examples. A technique is proposed in which noisy examples are detected and eliminated from the training set, and a hypothesis is then built from the set of remaining examples. The separation of noise detection and hypothesis formation has the advantage that noisy examples do not influence hypothesis construction as opposed to most standard approaches to noise handling in which the learner typically tries to avoid overfitting the noisy example set. Experimental results in a KRK (king-rook-king) chess endgame domain show the potential of this novel approach to noise handling.",
         "Introduction": "In an ideal inductive learning problem, an induced concept description (hypothesis H) will 'agree' with the classifications of the descriptions of all concept instances (training examples E). In practice, however, it frequently happens that data given to the learner contains various kinds of errors, either random or systematic. Random errors are usually referred to as noise."

More positively, AI offers mankind a unique avenue to circumvent its cognitive limits: (1) by acting as a prosthesis extending processing capacity and size of the knowledge base; (2) by offering tools for studying our own cognition; and (3) as a consequence of the previous item, by developing tools that increase the quality and quantity of our own thinking. These ideas are illustrated with chess expertise. \"...",

         "Abstract": "Understanding how look-ahead search and pattern recognition interact is one of the important research questions in the study of expert problem solving. This paper examines the implications of the template theory (Gobet & Simon, 1996a), a recent theory of expert memory, on the theory of problem solving in chess. Templates are \"chunks\" (Chase & Simon, 1973) that have evolved into more complex data structures and that possess slots allowing values to be encoded rapidly. Templates may facilitate search in three ways: (a) by allowing information to be stored into LTM rapidly; (b) by allowing a search in the template space in addition to a search in the move space; and (c) by compensating loss in the \"mind's eye\" due to interference and decay. A computer model implementing the main ideas of the theory is presented, and simulations of its search behaviour are discussed. The template theory accounts for the slight skill difference in average depth of search found in chess players, as well as for other empirical data.",

         "Abstract": "Perfect knowledge about a domain renders search unnecessary and, likewise, exhaustive search obviates heuristic knowledge. In practise, a tradeoff is found somewhere in the middle, since neither extreme is feasible for interesting domains. During the last two decades, the focus for increasing the performance of two-player game-playing programs has been on enhanced search, usually by faster hardware and/or more efficient algorithms. This paper revisits the issue of the relative advantages of improved search and knowledge. It introduces a revised search-knowledge tradeoff graph that is supported by experimental evidence for three different games (chess, Othello and checkers) using a new metric: the \"noisy oracle\". Previously published results in chess seem to contradict our model, postulating a linear increase in program strength with increasing search depth. We show that these results are misleading, and are due to properties of chess and chess-playing programs, not to the search-knowledge tradeoff.",
         "Introduction": "Many experiments have been performed in game-playing programs that measure the benefits of improved knowledge and/or deeper search. In particular, chess has been a popular application for these experiments. The explicit or implicit message of these works is that the results for chess are generalizable to other games. There have been few studies that examined the impact of improved knowledge on program performance "

         "Introduction": "The phrase Chess is the Drosophila of Artificial Intelligence is not my own invention. To the best of my recollection, I owe it to the late Alexander Kronrod, who may have used it as a defense against physicists when they complained that he used so much of their precious computer time in a mere chess match. This was probably in 1966 during the year long telegraph match between Stanford University and the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics in Moscow. Let me say that my thoughts were not entirely clear when choosing this topic and I am therefore very glad to be addressing a homogeneous audience of \"chess-types\". I will expand the subject slightly so as to allow discussion of the Drosophilas of AI in a more general sense. One of the pressures I was under came from people in computer science. They sometimes urged me to tackle topics of practical importance and to concentrate on experimental and theoretical work in precisely these applicable areas, as opposed to a backwater such as computer chess. This echoes a remark that might have been made to Thomas Hunt Morgan in 1910: \"Elephants are far more useful than fruitflies and who wants better fruitflies? So why don't you do your work in genetics on elephants rather than on fruitflies?\" To which Morgan could have countered: \"It takes no more than two weeks to breed a generation of fruitflies, you can keep thousands of them in a bottle and they are cheap to feed\"."

In particular, it is believed that chess masters use a pattern-based knowledge to analyze a position, followed by a pattern-based controlled search to verify or correct the analysis. In this paper, a first-order system, called PAL, that can learn patterns in the form of Horn clauses from simple example descriptions and general purpose knowledge is described. The learning model is based on (i) a constrained least general generalization algorithm to structure the hypothesis space and guide the learning process, and (ii) a pattern-based representation knowledge to constrain the construction of hypothesis. It is shown how PAL can learn chess patterns which are beyond the learning capabilities of current inductive systems. The same pattern-based approach is used to learn qualitative models of simple dynamic systems and counterpoint rules for two-voice musical pieces. Limitations of PAL in particular, and first-order systems in general, are exposed in domains where a large number of background definitions may be required for induction. Conclusions and future research directions are given.",

Productive research in AI, both practical and theoretical, benefits from a notion of intelligence that is precise enough to allow the cumulative development of robust systems and general results. The concept of rational agency has long been considered a leading candidate to fulfill this role. This paper outlines a gradual evolution in the formal conception of rationality that brings it closer to our informal conception of intelligence and simultaneously reduces the gap between theory and practice. Some directions for future research are indicated.",
         "Introduction": "My own motivation for studying AI is to create and understand intelligence as a general property of systems, rather than as a specific attribute of humans. I believe this to be an appropriate goal for the field as a whole, and it certainly includes the creation of useful artifacts-both as a spin-off and as a focus and driving force for technological development. The difficulty with this \"creation of intelligence\" view, however, is that it presupposes that we have some productive notion of what intelligence is. Cognitive scientists can say \"Look, my model correctly predicted this experimental observation of human cognition,\" and artifact developers can say \"Look, my system is saving lives/megabucks,\" but few of us are happy with papers saying \"Look, my system is intelligent.\" This difficulty is compounded further by the need for theoretical scaffolding to allow us to design complex systems with confidence and to build on the results of others. \"Intelligent\" must be given a definition that can be related directly to the system's input, structure, and output. Such a definition must also be general. Otherwise, AI subsides into a smorgasbord of fields-intelligence as chess playing, intelligence as vehicle control, intelligence as medical diagnosis."

         "Abstract": "In many application domains we have seen an explosive growth in the capabilities to both generate and collect data. Representative examples are business, medical, and scientific databases. In the game of chess (and similar games), we have a similar situation. Moreover, in chess we have gigantic databases with perfect information available. An endgame database is a very rare case of an information source with complete knowledge. However, this information, although complete, is not in a form which is particularly useful to human beings. Therefore, the raw data inside an endgame database have to be transformed into knowledge in understandable form. This task concerning chess endgame databases is, in principle, the same as in KDD in general. This paper summarizes a few results from literature where knowledge (especially patterns) has been discovered for simple chess endgames -in most cases this has been done empirically, by intuition, and interacting with the computer, but not automatically. Up to now, there are almost no satisfying results for practical endgames to extract knowledge in an automatic way. The main contribution of this paper is to present a new chess endgame database from which we have extracted knowledge automatically using decision trees -a method well-known from Machine Learning. Additionally, a mechanism for automatic feature discovery is introduced.",

This approach differs decisively from human game playing, of which intuition and use of high-level game-specific knowledge is very typical. Some attempts to make computers play like humans have been made in chess, and actually with quite good results. However, this is true only in some particular parts of chess game, for example endgames with only few pieces left on the board. Now there are some new results of using this approach to bridge. A hierarchical task-network planner with multi-agent methods has been implemented to represent bridge knowledge as schemes, that are a very human-like way of representing different strategies. This paper aims to describe the way of human game-playing compared to computer approach, and this paper studies some techniques that have been tried to make computers play intelligently. Finally, this paper tries to study, why planning has worked well in bridge, what planning techniques have made this success possible, and could this planning approach be copied in some other games.",

Investigations into the rhetoric of scientific texts, the ' language games ' of calculation, experimentation and proof, and the uses of textbooks, reports and specialized journals in the formation of scientific communities have all brought a growing awareness of what the American author Edgar Allan Poe (1809-49) heralded as ' The Power of Words '. In discussing several works of this author, who perhaps more than any of his ' literary ' contemporaries grappled with the growing dominance of science and technology in his time, this paper shows the potential ambiguity and polyvalence of the rhetoric of science. Poe's writings exploit this increasingly powerful language in a variety of ways : through logical proofs, satires, hoaxes, and the analysis of mysteries, codes and poetry, notably his own. Poe's unorthodox use of scientific rhetoric highlights the importance of historically specific modes of discourse for the consolidation of truth."

         "Introduction": "Chess has long been a favorite testing ground for man vs. machine. But while multi-million dollar computers plunge their way through billions of positions every move, Gary Kasparov claims to consider only 3 positions for every tick of the chess clock. At the center of chess only one fundamental problem exists: what is the value of a given board? From these simple numbers, huge search trees are generated and analyzed. Computer players like Deep Blue hide their lack of insight on the value question by having deep searches and large memorized standard opening lookup tables. Their evaluation functions are usually crafted directly by chess experts, such as Kasparov himself, but once crystallized, they never evolve except through human intervention. This paper will consider the use of an adaptive evaluation chess function based on material worth through use of perceptron-learning. The material evaluation method is by far the most popular method for playing chess, and is evident even in grandmaster-level play. It is centered on knowing the relative worth of chess pieces so that exchanges can be judged and board-worth easily quantified. By treating relative worths of pieces as weights to a perceptron, the learning updates should converge to, or even improve upon, the accepted chess standard values. This will be tested through studying existing, selfplay, and competition games. The table above represents the most popular values currently in use. First notice that there are no allowances made as to which pawn, knight, bishop, or rook is being considered: all are treated equally. Position is, of course, the other major aspect of chess analysis. Allowing for this, the perceptron weights I use consider the relative worth of each and every piece on the board. It is my hope that the result of such an analysis will yield an expanded-value rating system which may, in future, supplant those shown above."

Adopting an evaluation function that returned a probability distribution over values likely to be taken at a given position, they described how to build a model of uncertainty and use it for utility directed growth of the search tree and for deciding on a move after search was completed. In some games, such as chess or Othello, the same position can occur more than once, collapsing the game tree to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This induces correlations among the distributions at sibling nodes. The present paper discusses some issues that arise in extending our algorithms to a DAG. We g i v e a simply described algorithm for correctly propagating distributions up a game DAG, taking account of dependencies induced by the DAG structure. This algorithm is exponential time in the worst case. We p r o ve that it is #P complete to correctly propagate distributions up a game DAG. We suggest how our exact propagation algorithm can yield a fast but inexact heuristic.",

         "Introduction": "Towards the end of the 15th century Medieval chess underwent a dramatic change with new rules -those we call now \"modern chess\" (1)."

         "Introduction": "It is odd that chess grandmasters often disagree in their analysis of positions, sometimes even of simple ones, and that a grandmaster can hold his own against an powerful analytic machine such as Deep Blue. The fact that there must exist pure winning strategies for chess is used to construct a control strategy function. It is then shown that chess strategy is equivalent to an autonomous system of differential equations, and conjectured that the system is chaotic. If true the conjecture would explain the forenamed peculiarities and would also imply that there cannot exist a static evaluator for chess."

         "Abstract": "We i n vestigate Monte-carlo sampling in games with imperfect information. We s h o w that for very simple game trees the chance of nding the optimal strategy with Monte-carlo sampling rapidly approaches zero as the number of moves in the game increases. We explain this sub-optimality b y identifying the di erent kinds of errors that can arise, and by analysing their interplay. We also relate our test results to real games, suggesting why the error rates observed in practice may not be so high.",

         "Abstract": "Garry Kasparov made two allegations of unfairness in his recent chess match with the computer `Deep Blue'. The purpose of this inquiry is to determine whether the ethos of the contest would be violated if the purported activities had occurred and on what grounds. Kasparov's first allegation, that the program was tampered with during play, would if true, violate fair play as it would encroach on Deep Blue's autonomy, a necessary condition for fair play in individual strategic endeavours. The most charitable interpretation of Kasparov's second allegation, that scouting information was used in an unfair manner, concerns questions of the nature of the identity of artificial individuals. Consideration of this issue finds Kasparov's claim groundless. [1]    In a highly publicised chess match, grandmaster Garry Kasparov was beaten by a chess program on an IBM RS/6000 SP computer referred to as `Deep Blue.' At a press conference after the final game of the match, Kasparov complained of unfairness making two specific allegations: (1) that Deep Blue's programmers tampered with the program during play and (2) that the program was designed with a large amount of specific information about his past matches which the program utilised unfairly in determining its moves. The purpose of this inquiry is to examine these claims of unfairness in light of the strange circumstances of the contest, i.e., having a non-human competitor, and determine whether they are justified and if so, on what grounds.",
         "Introduction": "While the claim of mid-game tampering has been denied by the programming team and is unsubstantiated by physical evidence, the purpose here is to determine whether this would in fact have been unfair had it occurred and on what grounds."

However, Gobet and Simon (1996a) have recently shown that there is a skill effect with random chess positions as well. The impact of this result for theories of expert memory is discussed.

         "Introduction": "Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca's hemorrhagic stroke in 1942 has been regarded as classical and thus as having no neurologic scientific relevance. However, a review of data from his autopsy is significant in that it reveals something little known and poorly understood at the time -subendocardial hemorrhage. This pathologic observation is unusual; therefore, we wanted to study this finding in the light of recent explanations, namely, sympathetic activation caused by stroke, in a historic case, namely that of a celebrity who by some accounts was the greatest chess player of all times. BRIEF BIOGRAPHY Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca was born in Havana, Cuba, on 19 November 1888. He was a prodigy who learned chess at the age of 4. Capablanca won the Championship of Cuba when he was 12. In New York in 1909, he won a match against Frank J. Marshall, Champion of the United States, by 8 victories, 14 draws and only 1 defeat. Capablanca won the Chess World Championship against the German Emmanuel Lasker in Havana in 1921. Capablanca came to be called the chess machine. However, in 1927 in Buenos Aires, he lost his world title to the Russian Alexander Aljechin in a long and hard contest. Aljechin, offering a number of excuses, never allowed a rematch for the worldwide title."

Heian Shogi is an ancient game only briefly described in the literature. Therefore, it is impossible to know exactly how it was played. Through game-theoretic analyses of rules, we estimate the historical changes of this ancient game. Our method provides a new innovative approach to guess logically how these ancient games actually have been played. This paper focuses upon the game results of the KGK endgame on N\u00d7N boards, applying gameprogramming methods. Then it determines the size of the boards in which the side of King and Gold always wins except trivially drawn cases with the Gold being captured. Based on the analyses, we discuss the rules of Heian Shogi. We specifically provide a logical interpretation of the shift from the 8\u00d78 board to the 9\u00d79 board in the evolutionary history of Shogi.",

We conclude that for computer chess no practical alternative exists, but many promising ideas have good potential to change that in the future.",

However, it is necessary to stress again that the above listed de ciencies of alpha-beta are considering its basic formulation as given in KM75 . The following enhancements of alphabeta greatly increase the e ciency of practical alpha-beta implementations for many domains. Nonetheless, these problems still exist, they are merely masked."

Fortunately, these are grounded in the first bit of the journey, now behind us. Thirty years of computer vision reveals that 1 MIPS can extract simple features from real-time imagery--tracking a white line or a white spot on a mottled background. 10 MIPS can follow complex gray-scale patches--as smart bombs, cruise missiles and early self-driving vans attest. 100 MIPS can follow moderately unpredictable features like roads--as recent long NAVLAB trips demonstrate. 1,000 MIPS will be adequate for coarse-grained three-dimensional spatial awareness--illustrated by several mid-resolution stereoscopic vision programs, including my own. 10,000 MIPS can find three-dimensional objects in clutter--suggested by several \"bin-picking\" and high-resolution stereo-vision demonstrations, which accomplish the task in an hour or so at 10 MIPS. The data fades there--research careers are too short, and computer memories too small, for significantly more elaborate experiments."

         "Abstract": "For half a century since computers came into existence, the goal of finding elegant and efficient algorithms to solve ``simple'' (well-defined and well-structured) problems has dominated algorithm design. Over the same time period, both processing and storage capacity of computers have increased roughly by a factor of 10^6. The next few decades may well give us a similar rate of growth in raw computing power, due to various factors such as continuing miniaturization, parallel and distributed computing. If a quantitative change of orders of magnitude leads to qualitative changes, where will the latter take place? Many problems exhibit no detectable regular structure to be exploited, they appear ``chaotic'', and do not yield to efficient algorithms. Exhaustive search of large state spaces appears to be the only viable approach.

         "Introduction": "The concept of search plays an ambivalent role in computer science. On one hand, it is one of the fundamental concepts on which computer science is built, perhaps as fundamental as computability or complexity: any problem whatsoever can be seen as a search for ``the right answer''. On the other hand, despite its conceptually clear algorithmic nature, the problem domain ``search'' has not developed as rich a theory as, for example, algorithm complexity. When discussing search, a dozen unrelated techniques come to mind, ranging from binary search to fashionable trends such as neural nets or genetic algorithms."

We introduce a combination of the gaze contingent window paradigm and the \ufffd change blindness\ufffd flicker paradigm, and document dramatically larger visual spans for experts while processing structured, but not random, chess positions. In addition, in a check detection task, a minimized 3x3 chessboard containing a King and potentially checking pieces was displayed. In this task, experts made fewer fixations per trial, and had a greater proportion of fixations between individual pieces, rather than on pieces. Our results provide strong evidence for a perceptual encoding advantage for experts attributable to chess experience, rather than to a general perceptual or memory superiority.",

There is a plurality of scienti\u00ae c, philosophical, and other perspectives from which chess can be viewed. Some attention must be drawn to these various ways of conceptualizing the game, but the main emphasis of the paper lies in uncovering certain philosophically \u00b1 and metaphilosophically \u00b1 relevant basic assumptions of chess. It is argued that the thought patterns and reasoning procedures typical of chess seem to merge into those practised in philosophy. Moreover, we face in the comm on area of chess and other disciplines a multifarious possibility of research programmes, which promise to turn out useful both for the scienti\u00ae c and aesthetic understanding, and perhaps also for the chess tournament practice. Certain philosophical insights inspired by the practice of chess may lead us to transform our views about various complex human phenomena: not only about the nature of calculatory problem-solving and the relation between human intelligence and arti\u00ae cial intelligence, but also about ethical reasoning and even philosophical argumentation itself.",

The present paper is our \u00ae rst comprehensive effort to explore the nature of chess philoso phically \u00b1 and chess as an illuminating analogy to the philosophical quest.

This paper addresses the rst of these strengths and proposes an example-based reasoning mechanism to select candidate moves from a given chess position. The mechanism automatically generates an example-base from a database of grandmaster chess games using Principal Component Analysis to characterise the positions in the games database.

         "Introduction": "Computer Chess has long been viewed as a test bed for Arti cial Intelligence and the work in this area has added greatly to our repertoire of search algorithms 1 6 . Today, the best chess computer, Deep Blue II, can successfully challenge the world's leading player. If we examine how Deep Blue II achieved this we see that it was mainly based on the application of brute force methods. Deep Blue II still looks at all legal moves in a position, and using clever\" brute force techniques, crunches through all the possibilities. However, with its hardware assisted move generation and evaluation, Deep Blue II is capable of examining 200 million positions per second. To a large extent it is this combination of brute force and speed that has led to Deep Blue II's success. When you compare Deep Blue II's processing speed to the average speed of a chess grandmaster, 1 position per second, the question is not how can a computer beat a chess grandmaster but rather how d o c hess grandmasters beat computers? Early studies 7 showed that grandmasters rarely search more than 100 branches in any position and that on the basis of search statistics alone, it is very hard to tell if a search was performed by a grandmaster or an average club player. Grandmasters did not look at signi cantly more variations than the average club player did, they just look at the most signi cant v ariations, and hence selected better moves. In computing terms, a human grandmaster's strength lies in the ability to significantly prune the search tree and to correctly evaluate the resulting positions. This paper addresses the rst of these strengths and uses example-based reasoning as the mechanism to select candidate moves from a given chess position. A database of games played by the best human chess grandmasters is analysed using a multivariate technique called Principal Component Analysis in order to characterise each of the positions that occurred in the grandmaster games in an instance space. Given a new position, the instance space is searched and a ranked list of moves played by grandmasters in similar\" positions is returned."

However, temporal difference learning is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that has been researched and applied to various prediction problems with promising results. This paper discusses the application of temporal-difference-learning in training a neural network to play a scaled-down version of Chinese Chess. Preliminary results show that this technique is favorable for producing desired results. In test cases where minimal factors of the game are presented, the network responds favorably. However, when introducing more complexity, the network does not function as well, but generally produces reasonable results. These results indicate that temporal difference learning has the potential to solve real-world problems of equal or greater complexity. Continuing research will most likely lead to more responsive and accurate systems in the future.",
         "Introduction": "Neural networks have been widely implemented for solving various problems, mostly classification, pattern recognition, and function approximations. However, they have not been researched as extensively in the \"science\" of games. This shortcoming may be due to two reasons. Games may be considered trivial subjects not worthy of serious research, and neural networks have not yet evolved into a precise science. Thus, complex problems such as those presented by strategic games cannot be readily fed into a generic neural network and be expected to output reasonable results. There are many areas in neural networks that have yet to be discovered and explored in order to sufficiently handle or even solve complex problems. Artificial intelligence (AI) today is just that --artificial, and only capable of solving a fraction of what genuine intelligence (humans) can solve. Therein lies the justification for designing neural networks to play games and solve puzzles. Though they may seem to not yield any obvious applications in other fields, through this research new learning methods may be developed that can be applied to similar real-life problems and new insights may be gained."

There has been little work on applying modern plan-ning techniques to adversarial domains where this assump-tion does not hold. This paper discusses the development o f an HTN Adversarial Planning architecture and the issues in-volved in successfully applying such a goal driven approach in complex domains. The architecture was tested by using it to build a reasoning system name gobi able to plan for Go problems of the types commonly found in teaching books. gobi only has limited knowledge but still performs well on a signi cant subset of Go problems. The Results also opened up interesting new approaches to tackling the problem of programming for Go but this paper concentrates on the planning aspect.",
         "Introduction": "This paper addresses the key issue of goal decomposition schemes for HTN Adversarial Planning and suggests that the knowledge of relationships and interactions between goals is the key in uence in deciding upon a decomposition scheme. We describe an approach which uses \\early grounding\" to cope with these interactions, which i n a n a d v ersarial domain are generally very signi cant. We also highlight the possibility of adding data driven aspects into such a system which m a y be essential in some domains (Go almost certainly being one). The planning architecture performed well when it was ap-plied to the game of Go, a very complex game-playing do-main. This demonstrates that the HTN Adversarial Planning approach can be useful for such hard problems. Section 1.1 introduces HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) Adversarial Planning, outlines the general approach adopted here and presents Go as a complex test domain. Section 2 describes the form of an adversarial plan. Section 3 gives an overview of the planning architecture. Section 4 focuses on the goal decomposition schemes which are the heart of the planning system. Sections 5 and 6 give results of applying the architecture to Go followed by conclusions."
